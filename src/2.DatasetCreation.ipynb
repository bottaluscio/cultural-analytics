      "The World Health Organisation has suggested it is time for countries to have a conversation about mandatory COVID-19 vaccines, saying: \"It's a healthy debate to have.\" Robb Butler, executive director for WHO Europe, told Kay Burley on Sky News: \"Mandatory vaccination can, but doesn't always increase uptake.\" However, he suggested countries - and individuals - should now be thinking about the issue. Live COVID updates from across the UK and around the world He added: \"There are lessons of history here where mandates have come at the expense of trust, social inclusion. So it is very delicate, but we believe it is time to have that conversation, from an individual and population-based perspective.\" Advertisement Cases are rising again in much of Europe - sharply in the case of countries like Germany, the Netherlands and Austria, with the latter going back into a full lockdown as a result. Mr Butler said only 54% of the population of the 53 WHO Europe region member states are vaccinated, \"so there is so much work to be done, still. We are not there yet\". He added: \"It looks like we are going to have a worrisome season ahead.\" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 0:35 'Time for a conversation on mandatory jabs' Mr Butler pointed to a study last week in the BMJ which suggested 53% of transmission was prevented by mask use. He said only 48% of the population on the continent was using masks. \"If we see this go up, we will see a reduction in cases and deaths,\" he said. \"If we saw 95% universal mask use we can project we could save about 160,000 lives (in Europe).\" He said he is \"alarmed\" by the surge in COVID-19 infections across Europe as the continent battles a fresh wave of the virus. Half a million more deaths could be recorded by early 2022 if measures are not taken to stem the spread of the deadly coronavirus, he warned. \"We've just surpassed, very sadly, the 1.5 million deaths mark last week,\" he said. \"If we continue on the current course we are projecting a further 500,000 deaths by spring next year. \"That's really worrisome.\" Asked what was driving the resurgence in mainland Europe, he said it was partly due to there being too many vulnerable populations to infection, but also the \"waning immunity\" of vaccines, particularly after 30 weeks. \"The majority of people in intensive care units are the unvaccinated,\" he said. Other compounding factors include the more transmissible Delta variant - which accounts for 99% of cases - the winter season, people moving indoors and the need for face masks and more ventilation. Mr Butler said: \"What we need is every member of society vaccinated.\" Follow the Daily podcast on Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts, Spotify, Spreaker Thousands of protesters rallied in cities across Europe over the weekend against leaders looking to tighten COVID-19 restrictions to curb the latest wave of infections. Also asked about mandatory jabs in Britain, Deputy PM Dominic Raab told Kay Burley on Sky News: \"Maybe in some countries, but I don't think in the UK, given the extraordinary success we've had in rolling out the vaccine. \"The rollout scheme of boosters is working very effectively. It shows we've got the right balance in the UK and we should stick to our guns.\" He added: \"I don't think we need to divert from the course we're on right now.\"\n",

William Watson: Vaccine mandates not worth cost of tearing society apart Data shows that mandates for other vaccines have a limited effect Photo by Carlos Osorio/Reuters files Article content Henry Kissinger used to say (quoting political scientist W. S. Sayre, it seems) that university politics are so vicious and bitter because the stakes are so small. Vaccination politics, as we see them evolving, are equally vicious and bitter. A piece in this week’s Economist suggests maybe it’s because the fact base isn’t clear. (Before we go on, just so you know, I’m double-vaxxed and will happily take a booster when it’s offered.) Advertisement 2 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content The Economist piece is the latest edition of “Graphic detail,” a weekly feature that artfully turns a data set into a chart illuminating a current issue: If a picture’s worth a thousand words, a good chart should retail for at least 750. The headline for this one was: “The impact of vaccine mandates is modest, but potentially crucial.” The “deck,” which elaborates on the headline, was: “Allowing exceptions sharply reduces mandates’ effectiveness.” We apologize, but this video has failed to load. tap here to see other videos from our team. Try refreshing your browser, or William Watson: Vaccine mandates not worth cost of tearing society apart Back to video In fact, the headline and deck suggest vaccine politics at the Economist, though probably not vicious and bitter, are at least lively. Why do I say that? The rest of the article doesn’t really confirm that “allowing exceptions sharply reduces mandates’ effectiveness.” In fact, the piece concludes that mandates increase take-up by 1.1 percentage points. That’s something, but hardly overwhelming. Advertisement 3 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content A handy chart illustrates the point by grouping U.S. states into those that allow exemptions from childhood measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccinations for: 1) medical reasons only, 2) medical and religious reasons and 3) medical, religious and philosophical reasons. States in category 1 have vaccination rates ranging from about 95 per cent to almost 100, with — check your prejudices at the door — the highest-vaccinated state being Mississippi. States in category 2 range from about 91 per cent to about 98 per cent (“about” because I’m reading off a chart: charts have their disadvantages, too). Finally, in category 3, states range from just below 90 per cent vaccination to almost 98 per cent. The 98 per cent was Texas. Surprised? The below 90 per cent was in Colorado — which did surprise me, since Colorado, a state that leans blue to purple in U.S. political chromatics, is not your typical Trumpville. Advertisement 4 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content More On This Topic William Watson: Thank you, Luxembourg! William Watson: The conservative temperament William Watson: ESG won't pay my bills Bottom line? Or, this being a chart, lasting impression? Rates of take-up vary across states from under 90 per cent to almost 100 per cent. But if you control for demographic and other variables, you’re left with that 1.1 percentage-point difference that does seem attributable to mandates. The Economist stresses that even this one-in-a-hundred effect might make the difference between reaching herd immunity and not. For measles, for instance, 95 per cent seems to be the herd-immunity bar. For COVID-19, however, it’s pretty clear, nobody has an estimate of that threshold that is precise to 1.1 percentage points, plus or minus. Advertisement 5 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content It is true, as The Economist points out, that in the 24 hours after France announced proof of vaccination would be required to enter many public spaces, more than a million people signed up for jabs. But how many eventually would have signed up anyway? Not all, certainly. But maybe most. In that case, the mandate would have affected the timing of jabs but not overall take-up. What’s wanting is a natural experiment of the sort for which this year’s Nobel Prize in economics was given, one where jurisdictions identical in almost all other regards take different approaches to mandates. But if the mandates don’t make a big difference in take-up, that raises the question whether it’s worth tearing the country apart over them — especially now that, with the election over, the political advantage of tearing the Conservative Party apart is reduced? People who pride themselves on adopting only evidence-based policies would certainly want to think about that. Maybe the prime minister was right last January when he said that “more extreme measures (such as mandates) could have real divisive impacts on community and country.” Advertisement 6 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content None of this is to say people shouldn’t get vaccinated. Other compelling data, some of it also in charts, is Alberta’s rolling summary of vaccine outcomes. For instance, Table 8 on the page “Vaccine outcomes” looks at the last four months of admissions to ICUs. Among Albertans 60 years and older, 72 people who were fully vaccinated were admitted to the ICU. (I don’t know why these are called “breakthrough” cases: it’s not an achievement you want on your résumé.) In that same age group, 392 people who were unvaccinated went into the ICU with COVID. Yes, that’s only — “only”!— five times more. But in that age group the vaccination rate in Alberta is now over 90 per cent. So the 72 are drawn from 90 per cent of the relevant population, the 392 from just 10 per cent of it. Zero admissions from double-vaxxed people would be far better. But if I have to choose, I prefer my chances as one of the 90 per cent. Vaccination clearly isn’t perfect. And some anti-vaxxers really are flaming idiots. Neither fact means mandates must be worth the social disruption they’re causing.

      "Novak Djokovic says he is prepared to miss Wimbledon & French Open in order to avoid coronavirus vaccine Novak Djokovic says he will not defend his Wimbledon or French Open titles if the tournaments require mandatory vaccination for competitors Novak Djokovic says he was not against vaccination but would not defend his Wimbledon or French Open titles if he was forced to take the jab against Covid-19. Djokovic, who is unvaccinated, was deported from Australia ahead of the first Grand Slam of the year after 11 days following two visa cancellations, two court challenges and five nights at an immigration detention hotel. \"Yes, that is the price that I'm willing to pay.\" Djokovic is willing to miss more events over vax rules \"I was never against vaccination,\" he told the BBC, \"but I've always supported the freedom to choose what you put in your body.\" Despite watching his rival, Rafael Nadal, winning a record 21st Grand Slam title in Melbourne last month, the world No 1 says he will not defend his Wimbledon or French Open titles if the tournaments require mandatory vaccination for competitors. \"Yes, that is the price that I'm willing to pay,\" Djokovic said when asked if he would sacrifice participating in the competitions. \"I say that everybody has the right to choose or act or say or feel whatever is appropriate for them.\" He went on to explain: \"The principles of decision making on my body are more important than any title or anything else. I'm trying to be in tune with my body as much as I possibly can.\" Djokovic is a six-time Wimbledon champion but will he defend his title at the All England Club this summer? Djokovic also distanced himself from the anti-vaccination movement, despite being deported from Melbourne ahead of the Australian Open last month amid concerns about his vaccine status. He said: \"I have never said I'm part of that movement. \"It's really unfortunate that there has been this kind of misconception and wrong conclusion based upon something that I completely disagree with,\" he added. He told the broadcaster he was \"keeping [his] mind open\" to the possibility of getting vaccinated in the future \"because we are all trying to find collectively, a best possible solution to end Covid\". \"I was never against vaccination. I understand that globally, everyone is trying to put a big effort into handling this virus and seeing, hopefully, an end soon to this virus.\" Djokovic spoke about his deportation from Australia Djokovic addressed his deportation from Australia after some had suggested that it was convenient he had tested positive for Covid in mid-December. The timing allowed him to be granted a medical exemption to attend the tournament. Djokovic said: \"I understand that there is a lot of criticism, and I understand that people come out with different theories on how lucky I was or how convenient it is. \"But no one is lucky and convenient... getting Covid. Millions of people have and are still struggling with Covid around the world. \"So I take this very seriously, I really don't like someone thinking I've misused something or in my own favour, in order to, you know, get a positive PCR test and eventually go to Australia. \"I was really sad and disappointed with the way it all ended for me in Australia. It wasn't easy. \"I was not deported from Australia on the basis that I was not vaccinated, or I broke any rules or that I made an error in my visa declaration. \"The reason why I was deported from Australia was because the Minister for Immigration used his discretion to cancel my visa based on his perception that I might create some anti-vax sentiment in the country or in the city, which I completely disagree with.\" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Djokovic returned to his native Serbia where he was greeted by dozens of fans at Belgrade airport Djokovic returned to his native Serbia where he was greeted by dozens of fans at Belgrade airport The Serbian is set to return to action at the Dubai Duty Free Tennis Championships, which begin on February 21. Entrants to Dubai do not need to be vaccinated against Covid-19 and it is a tournament Djokovic has won five times. Participation in Indian Wells, Miami and the US Open in serious jeopardy The world No 1 is a five-time winner at Indian Wells Neither the ATP nor WTA tours require players to be vaccinated against Covid-19. However, non-US citizens must be fully vaccinated to travel to the US by plane, according to the CDC. Travellers are required to show a negative Covid-19 test result or documentation of recovery from Covid-19 when traveling to the US by air. Limited exceptions apply. Djokovic is a five-time champion at Indian Wells, where he hasn't played since 2019. Fans attending Indian Wells from March 7-20 are required to show valid proof of full vaccination. The world No 1 hasn't played a match since November at the Davis Cup in Madrid. What about the French Open and Wimbledon? Djokovic is a 20-time Grand Slam champion but still not vaccinated, and prepared to sacrifice titles to stay that way Speaking in January, the French Sports Ministry said there would be no exemption from a new vaccine pass law, which requires people to have vaccination certificates to enter public places such as restaurants, cafes and cinemas. \"This will apply to everyone who is a spectator or a professional sportsperson. And this is until further notice,\" the ministry said. \"As far as Roland Garros is concerned, it's in May. The situation may change between now and then and we hope it'll be more favourable. So we'll see but clearly there's no exemption.\" Organisers of the Monte Carlo Masters, which Djokovic has won twice, are awaiting French government guidelines for the next edition in April, while he could face issues ahead of the Italian Open in Rome in May due to tough anti-Covid restrictions in the country. Wimbledon organisers AELTC are also yet to finalise safety arrangements for the major. The Lawn Tennis Association said entry requirements for its events, some of which serve as Wimbledon warm-ups, would be determined by the government. The US Open would follow New York City Department of Health guidelines. Don't forget to follow us on skysports.com/tennis, our Twitter account @skysportstennis & Sky Sports - on the go!

During a briefing on Tuesday, provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry was asked whether B.C. has had reported cases of acute hepatitis in kids who had contracted the novel coronavirus.

Researchers from Simon Fraser University surveyed 738 people who use drugs in Vancouver and found that nearly 37 per cent reported using poorer quality drugs. Those who reported a decline in the drug quality were more likely to report experiencing a recent non-fatal overdose, which is associated with an increased risk of a fatal overdose, said the study, which was published in the journal Drug and Alcohol Dependence.

The province says there are 1,555 people hospitalized with the virus, up from 1,213 the previous day. The number of people in intensive care decreased slightly today to 188 from 201 the day before. Health officials are also reporting 1,089 new infections detected by PCR testing, which is limited to certain groups. The scientific director of Ontario’s panel of COVID-19 advisers has said multiplying the daily case count by 20 would give a more accurate picture. Nearly 27 per cent of long-term care homes in Ontario have active COVID-19 outbreaks. Advertisement 13 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.

Toronto Maple Leafs head coach Sheldon Keefe told CBC, “I think the biggest thing at this point of the year really is just to do all that we can to avoid any false positives or anything that might come up that would impact our group.” Advertisement 14 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.

And we indicated that the approach will not be sustainable. … I think a shift would be very important.” He said increased knowledge about the virus and better tools to combat it also suggested it was time for a change of strategy.

But two years into the pandemic, health officials in some countries are questioning the merits of repeated, mass testing when it comes to containing infections, particularly considering the billions it costs. Chief among them is Denmark, which championed one of the world’s most prolific COVID testing regimes early on. Lawmakers are now demanding a close study of whether that policy was effective. “We’ve tested so much more than other countries that we might have overdone it,” said Jens Lundgren, professor of infectious diseases at Rigshospitalet, University of Copenhagen, and a member of the government’s COVID advisory group.

      "Germany's tourism commissioner says he expects COVID-19 vaccines will become mandatory in the country, as cases surge there and elsewhere in Europe. Thomas Bareiss said the increasingly worsening situation in his nation makes it clear that sooner or later coronavirus inoculations will be compulsory and will be \"unavoidable\". He said it was wrong not to make COVID jabs mandatory from the start - but the decision not to at the time was \"understandable\". Neighbour Austria has said that vaccines will be mandatory from 1 February. Image: Thomas Bareiss believes a COVID vaccine mandate will be introduced in Germany. Pic: AP Follow live COVID updates Advertisement More restrictions are being introduced across the continent as infections soar and winter sets in. Austria and the Netherlands have gone back into forms of lockdown, sparking unrest in the past few days. Germany's states are introducing restrictions as well, with some regions cancelling their Christmas markets or banning the sale of alcohol. The nationwide seven-day rate of infections currently stands at 362.2 per 100,000 population - with the peak during last year's lockdown being 197.6. A number of states have a much higher figure than the national average, including Saxony at 793.7. Mr Bariess, who is a member of Angela Merkel's Christian Democratic Union, advises the federal government on their tourism policy. He told the German news agency DPA: \"In retrospect, it was wrong not to see that (compulsory vaccinations) right from the start. The hope at that time is understandable, but it was not realistic. \"For me it is politically no longer justifiable that entire industries, retailers, restaurants, clubs, bars and the entire cinema, cultural and event scene live in a state of crisis prescribed by the state for 20 months and are faced with great existential fears, while others...take the freedom not to vaccinate.\" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 0:42 Netherlands rocked by second night of COVID riots And Daniel Gunther, the CDU minister president of the Schleswig-Holstein state, told Die Welt that he would be prepared to introduce a mandate - and that blanket lockdowns are no longer \"appropriate\" as they were in times before vaccines. Tilman Kuban, head of the youth wing of the CDU, said: \"We need de facto compulsory vaccination and a lockdown for the unvaccinated.\" The CDU are not expected to be a part of the ruling coalition come December, as the centre-left Social Democrats (SPD), the libertarian Free Democrats (FDP) and the Greens all negotiate to form a government - with the SPD's Olaf Scholz expected to take over as chancellor. He wants to debate compulsory jabs for health workers - similar to the situation in the UK - although the FDP oppose this as they are more ideologically supportive of individual freedom. Earlier on Sunday, the UK's health secretary, Sajid Javid, ruled out broad compulsory vaccines in the UK. \"We are fortunate that in this country, although we have vaccine hesitancy, it is a lot lower than we are seeing in other places,\" he told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show. \"I just think on a practical level, taking a vaccine should be a positive choice. It should be something, if people are a bit reluctant, we should work with them and encourage them. \"In terms of mandatory vaccines for the general population I don't think that is something we would ever look at.\" According to the Johns Hopkins University tracker, 69% of the UK population is fully vaccinated, while 68% of Germans are double jabbed. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 17:03 England 'firmly' in COVID Plan A Mr Javid told Sky News that England is still well within the government's Plan A - and the country is \"not at the point to take further measures\" like the increased mask wearing and working from home requirements set out in Plan B. He added that England decided to open up more than other countries in the summer - which Mr Javid said was the \"best\" and \"safer\" time to do it.

Saskatchewan Health Authority CEO Scott Livingstone said Wednesday that the province is preparing air ambulance flights. Transfers to Ontario could likely happen this week, he said, but that depends on the admissions to Saskatchewan’s intensive care units. “We’ve been in discussion with Ontario to provide care to Saskatchewan residents in the event that we will not be able to care for them within our standard of care,” Livingstone said.

Article content On Tuesday, the province was two patients shy of having 116 people in its ICUs – the threshold that would trigger sending ICU patients out of province. The number also means Saskatchewan’s ICUs are nearing 150 per cent capacity, which is when the province has said it would activate its triage protocol. Saskatchewan has stopped all elective surgeries, started cancelling urgent surgeries and admitted adults into its children’s hospital. Additionally, more than 160 health-care workers have been redeployed. “We are seeing unprecedented rates of hospitalizations and ICU admissions. This is pushing the system to a place where we are not providing care to non-COVID patients across this province as we should be,” Livingstone said.

Betty Chaborek, who turned 77 on Wednesday, likened the easing of restrictions for fully vaccinated Canadians to “a super birthday present.” “I’m so excited that I can barely wait. I was ready to go today,” Chaborek said with a chuckle during a phone interview. The U.S. plan is set to take effect in early November, although a firm start date has not been released. It’s also unclear whether Canadians who received mixed vaccine doses will be deemed eligible.

The Windsor, Ont., resident said there had been many times during the pandemic when she’d stare at traffic on the Ambassador Bridge border crossing from her condo and wonder when she’d be allowed to drive over to see her family in the U.S. Prior to the U.S. land border closing to Canadians when the pandemic hit, Chaborek said she would visit her daughter, her son-in-law and their two children in Michigan almost every weekend. Chaborek said she’s looking forward to catching up with her family and celebrating upcoming holidays with them. “This is absolutely incredible that we have the freedom to live our life like we want,” she said. “It’s been too long.” Mike Osborne also couldn’t contain his excitement after hearing the news about the border reopening.

Article content The Welland, Ont., resident said he used to see his daughter, her husband and their two-year-old son in Niagara Falls, N.Y., a few times a week before the global health crisis began. “I’ve been waiting for such a long time to be able to cross over and see family actually, you know, physically, instead of it being always on FaceTime or Messenger and stuff like that,” he said. The border being closed was especially difficult for his family, Osborne said, as he lost his wife to cancer in May – three days after Mother’s Day – and his daughter could only come across into Canada for short compassionate visits. He and his family in the U.S. haven’t seen each other since his wife died, he added. “To know now that the border’s opening up to us, it’ll give us the time for us to heal together, in a physical way,” said Osborne.

The U.S. will not be requiring travellers to show proof of a negative test for COVID-19 as part of the new easing of restrictions. 2:20 p.m. Here’s a breakdown of unvaccinated Quebec health workers by region In Quebec, as of Monday, 22,446 health workers were unvaccinated – almost one-quarter of them in Montreal.

I remind you that this is a formal recommendation from public health, and I want to be very, very clear: we will be firm on Oct. 15.” Today, he pushed back that deadline to Nov. 15.

Article content 12:05 p.m. After flipflop, Dubé insists new vaccination deadline – Nov. 15 – is firm After insisting for days that he wouldn’t extend Quebec’s vaccination deadline for health workers, Health Minister Christian Dubé did just that this morning. Under the province’s vaccine mandate, health workers had until Friday to get fully vaccinated or face possible suspension without pay. Forty-eight hours before that deadline, Dubé gave unvaccinated health employees a 30-day reprieve – they must now get their shots by Nov. 15. Speaking to reporters, Dubé said he’s “encouraged” by the rising vaccination rate among employees since he announced the vaccine mandate in August. About 96 per cent of health workers have now received at least one dose. Advertisement 17 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content However, about 22,000 employees are still not fully vaccinated – 14,613 have not received a single dose, while the other 7,833 having gotten their first jab. If Quebec suspended all of them as of Friday as originally planned, the health system would not be able to cope, Dubé said. Some operating rooms would have to close and some long-term care homes (CHSLDs) would have to close beds, he added. “We would find ourselves adding undue pressure on our network, and especially on the vaccinated health workers who have been at the front for months,” Dubé said. “We would run into a wall.” Dr. Lucie Opatrny, a deputy health minister, said the network would not have been overwhelmed but there would have been a “considerable reduction” in services in the health system. Advertisement 18 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content “Everything that is critical and important and urgent would have still continued because those plans have been worked on for weeks,” Opatrny told reporters. “It wouldn’t have been a breakdown but it would have been an important stress (on the network) and an important reduction in services.” The announcement came despite Dubé’s repeated assertions as recently as Tuesday that the deadline would not be delayed. Less than a week ago, he accused the Parti Québécois of being “irresponsible” for suggesting the deadline be delayed. On Wednesday, Dubé insisted that the new deadline is firm. “We want to give the unvaccinated staff extra time to get their dose,” he said. “I want to be clear: we will apply the mandatory vaccination for health workers, but postponing the deadline by 30 days is the best solution under the circumstances.” Advertisement 19 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.

That testing rule has now been extended to the private sector. And it may at a later date be extended to health employees who do not deal directly with patients.

Although the team considered a lab-leak incident the least likely hypothesis, the WHO director called for further research. U.S. President Joe Biden has criticized China for stonewalling efforts to understand the genesis of SARS-CoV-2, while China has accused the U.S. and its allies of blaming it for a pandemic that has killed almost 5 million people globally. Tedros has said that scientists still lack raw data on possible infections in late 2019. The WHO has proposed audits of the laboratories and research centers in Wuhan, the city where the first cases were identified, as well as studies on the animals, people and environments that may have played a role in the coronavirus’s emergence.

We will head into seasonal headwinds in terms of viral spread.” Kenney and Health Minister Jason Copping said Alberta’s vaccine passport, which was introduced three weeks ago as a restrictions exemption program, is having the desired effect.

      "Djokovic has previously expressed vaccine hesitancy, but could obtain a medical exemption to play in the Australian Open Australian Open organisers still do not know whether defending champion Novak Djokovic will play in next month's tournament. The world No 1, who has won the tournament nine times, has repeatedly refused to say whether he has been vaccinated against COVID-19, having previously expressed vaccine hesitancy. All players competing at Melbourne Park are required either to be vaccinated or to provide proof of medical exemption, but that will not be made public. There has been some anger in Australia at the idea Djokovic could secure an exemption in order to play.

That provides us with safety and an extra level of comfort on site. \"If Novak shows up at the Australian Open, he'll either be vaccinated or he'll have a medical exemption. (It's) his choice on his medical condition, it's his choice to keep (it) personal and private like all of us would do with any condition we may or may not have. \"We are not going to force him or ask him to disclose that.\" Tiley expressed confidence that Rafael Nadal, who is currently isolating with coronavirus as he contemplates his return to the tour following a foot problem, will be in Melbourne. Former world No 1 Rafael Nadal tested positive for Covid-19 earlier this week He is also expecting full crowds to be permitted at Melbourne Park but all the players will again stay in one hotel to try to reduce the risk of them catching or spreading coronavirus in the community. With rates of the Omicron variant surging around the world, there are major concerns that the opening Grand Slam of the new season, which begins on January 17, could be badly affected. Nadal, his coach Carlos Moya and fellow players Belinda Bencic and Ons Jabeur all announced positive tests for COVID-19 after playing an exhibition event in Abu Dhabi last week. Emma Raducanu had already been ruled out of the tournament and forced to isolate in Abu Dhabi after testing positive ahead of her match.

      "COVID-19 health passes - or \"green passes\" - are now compulsory for all workers in Italy. The rule was approved by Prime Minister Mario Draghi's cabinet in mid-September, forcing all workers to show either proof of vaccination, a negative test within the previous 48 hours, or recent recovery from infection. The certification is mandatory and applies to public and private workplaces, with both employees and employers risking fines if they don't comply. Image: Some Italian cities have seen protests against the green pass. Pic AP The pass is already required in Italy to enter museums, theatres, gyms and indoor restaurants, as well as to take long-distance trains and buses or domestic flights. The workplace requirement has sparked big protests in Rome, with some demonstrators turning violent and clashing with police last weekend. Advertisement More unrest is feared and workers at a main port have threatened a strike. The government hopes the pass will encourage unvaccinated Italians to get the jab. According to a government document seen by Reuters news agency, 15% of private and 8% of public sector workers have no green pass. But under the new rules they can be suspended without pay and fined if they work without it - a move that has been criticised by some. Image: The passes have already been introduced for bars, restaurants, cinemas and public transport The right-wing League's Luca Zaia, governor of Veneto, said: \"We will not be able to grant a swab every 48 hours to all the unvaccinated. \"The business people I am in contact with are extremely worried.\" The UIL union said in a statement: \"This is a very restrictive measure that could have a serious impact on social stability and exacerbate an already complicated situation.\" Unions said tests should be free for workers who don't want to be vaccinated, but the government said they would be capped at €15. Many employers' federations, however, backed the pass in the hope it would prevent future lockdowns.

Italy has recorded 4.71 million cases of COVID-19 and 131,000 deaths - the second highest number of deaths in Europe after the UK. As of 13 October, 41.9 million (70.4%) people have been fully vaccinated. Follow the Daily podcast on Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts, Spotify, Spreaker In the UK, the government rowed back on plans to bring in a vaccine certificate system for access to large and crowded venues such as nightclubs, but has kept the option on the table as part of its \"Plan B\" for winter. Care home workers will also need to be fully vaccinated by 11 November, and Health Secretary Sajid Javid has said the requirement is \"highly likely\" to be extended to all frontline NHS staff. Last month, the French government said about 3,000 workers in hospitals, care homes and health centres have been suspended for failing to comply with mandatory COVID vaccination.\n",

      "M ANY COUNTRIES did not require passports before the first world war. But as the conflict spread, states scrambled to introduce travel documents to help secure their borders. The result, after the armistice, was a bewildering smorgasbord of different information for different nationalities that could create chaos rather than clarity at border crossings. But returning to a world where people could travel freely across borders was by then unimaginable. Listen to this story. Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or Android Your browser does not support the element. Listen to this story Save time by listening to our audio articles as you multitask OK In 1920 the League of Nations stepped in. It designed a 32-page booklet with the country’s name on the cover and such basic personal information as place and date of birth. Some governments grumbled—France thought the booklet too expensive to print compared with its single sheet—and it took a few years for them to adapt. But today all passports follow the same format. Whether at Heathrow in Britain or Moshoeshoe I International in Lesotho, officials can glance at a passport and be fairly certain of its bearer’s travel privileges. During the covid-19 pandemic, a similar process is under way. States have rushed to create vaccine passports to stop the virus at the border—or at the doors to the restaurant or gym. Often people must prove that they have been vaccinated, recently tested negative or had covid and recovered. This time governments are not alone. Tech has thrown open the doors to firms like IBM and Microsoft, industry associations like the International Air Transport Association and non-governmental organisations like the World Economic Forum. Three undergraduates at the University of Applied Sciences Upper Austria spent last summer pulling all-nighters to build a pass that works across the European Union. They can’t afford much marketing, but the app, the GreenPass, has been downloaded 100,000 times. As during the Great War, urgency has trumped co-ordination. India, which has administered over a billion jabs, has a “CoWIN” certificate with a QR code, identifying information and, confusingly, a photograph not of the bearer but of the prime minister, Narendra Modi. People in England can choose between a QR code on the National Health Service ( NHS ) app or website or a letter of certification from their doctor. In America, where President Joe Biden has vowed not to create a national vaccination database, many different state and private health passes are in use. The trouble is that these passes are not interoperable. Most look the same: a QR code on a smartphone or piece of paper. Yet even scanning the codes can be a problem. Different verifier apps read different passes. Once scanned, the codes serve up widely varying information, depending on the national or local health systems or attitudes about privacy. Some vaccine passports, like the CommonPass used in parts of America, share raw data on vaccination status. Others, like the one issued by the NHS , yield only a symbol, a tick or a cross. And the rules of the game are not fixed. During a surge of infections this month, Israel yanked its “green pass” from 2m people who had not yet received booster jabs. The administrative, commercial and even psychological burdens are obvious at airports. Traveller numbers have dropped between 85% and 90%, yet reaching the gate has become a more demanding obstacle course than ever. Queues lengthen as anxious travellers fumble for slips of paper and QR codes. Officials struggle to keep track of which vaccines state regulators have approved and how long which test results are valid for which destinations. As Corneel Koster, chief customer and operating officer at Virgin Atlantic, an airline, puts it: “It’s kind of a jungle out there.” It is past time for standardisation. Yet designing a digital health pass is trickier than designing a travel document. Passports may reveal age, but vaccine passes are gateways to personal health information, potentially a great deal of it. That scares people. Even among countries with relatively high vaccination rates, support for vaccine passports varies, from 52% in Hungary to 84% in Britain (see chart). In India people are used to sharing their fingerprints and iris scans as part of the Aadhaar biometric ID system. Yet many, like Debjani Mazumder, a publishing executive in Delhi, worry about pharmaceutical companies and insurers getting hold of their health records. “I feel like a guinea pig,” Ms Mazumder says. In theory, digital technology should make it easy to verify vaccination status. Yet because verifying apps cannot recognise all QR codes, many verifiers take what Edgar Whitley at the London School of Economics calls a “flash-and-go” approach, simply eyeballing them. A black market is thriving. Oded Vanunu at Check Point Software Technologies, a cyber-security company, has posed as a buyer and sourced fake French vaccine certificates for €75 ($87), Russian ones for 9,500 roubles ($134) and Singaporean alternatives for €250 on the dark web and Telegram, a messaging app. These sham passes look the part but would fall short if properly scanned. When airline agents, employers and bar staff scan QR codes, they check for two things: confirmation that the bearer has been vaccinated or tested for covid and a digital signature proving the information comes from a trusted issuer. Uniformity across digital health passes would require broad agreement on exactly what health information to include, and how to label and package it. That ought to be relatively easy. In August, the World Health Organisation ( WHO ) published guidance recommending the minimum data for a certificate. The name and date of birth of the bearer plus the brand and batch number of a jab are considered necessary. Identifying who administered a jab—information some passes include—is not. What is trickier is creating a unified system for checking the digital signatures of health authorities. Creating a repository of all trusted signatures is an expensive and politically fraught task. Countries with a national health service, like Britain, have just one issuer. But in America, there are around 300, including state governments, hospitals and pharmacies. Without a trusted way to verify certificates across borders, even the most advanced technology falters. George Connolly is chief executive of OneLedger, a firm that designed OnePass, a blockchain-based vaccine passport. He says it has access to data from only around 20 jurisdictions. So he gets contractors to check passes from elsewhere by phoning and e-mailing health authorities. Dakota Gruener, head of ID 2020, a public-private partnership focused on digital ID s, rolls her eyes. “Do you need blockchain? No,” she says. “Is blockchain a distraction? Yes.” Luddites have reason to feel smug. As Albert Fox Cahn of the Surveillance Technology Oversight Project, an advocacy group, puts it: “There is so much money being spent on building this really shiny new metal fence around our society when the wooden gate was working just fine.” Bits of paper signed by clinicians, like the WHO ’s “yellow card”, have sufficed as immunisation records for decades. These are more globally inclusive, given that many people in poor countries do not have smartphones. Judging by black-market prices, paper passes are not much easier to forge. Fake versions of paper vaccine certificates issued by America’s Centres for Disease Control and Prevention go for $150 apiece on Telegram, more than some digital alternatives. Over the borderline The biggest impediment to sensible vaccine passports is not technology but geopolitics. It would take a universally trusted organisation with sophistication in health, technology and diplomacy to get countries to agree on global standards. This might seem an obvious role for the WHO . But, embroiled in the rivalry between America and China, the organisation has been blasted from all sides for its handling of the pandemic. On digital passes, the WHO has got itself in a muddle. Even as it has published lengthy documents describing what vaccine passports should look like, it has insisted that proof of vaccination should not be required for international travel when vaccine distribution is so skewed to rich nations. Crucially, the WHO has declined to involve itself in validation and verification. Maintaining a register of trusted signatories would require a large staff. It would also require politically charged choices, like whether to recognise signatures from Palestine or Afghanistan, and which vaccines are good enough. The WHO would also have to take some kind of action when a state broke the rules. Carmen Dolea, head of the International Health Regulations Secretariat at the WHO , says this task goes beyond its mandate. “There are liability issues,” she adds. Still, clumsily, the world does seem to be converging on a few standards and technologies. The European Union’s standards for digital covid certificates, for example, are also being used by Turkey and Switzerland. India’s have been picked up by Sri Lanka and the Philippines. The next step, the WHO says, is for countries to negotiate bilateral or regional arrangements. Recent negotiations between Britain and India illustrate how messy this can be. Britain had refused to accept India’s CoWIN vaccine certificates, in part because they did not state the bearer’s precise date of birth. The government in New Delhi included only the year of birth because many poor Indians do not know their exact birthdays. A tit-for-tat escalation in travel restrictions kept families apart and business trips on hold for weeks, before an agreement was reached earlier this month. India added the precise date, reasoning that most people who can afford international travel know their birthdays. Some wonks still think they can fix the problems of poor governance with more technology. Nandan Nilekani, co-founder of Infosys, a tech giant, and the driving force behind India’s Aadhaar system, is pinning his hopes on “adaptors” that convert one type of pass into another. Creating the right adaptors would be like finding a way to save shoppers from having to walk around with American Express cards, MasterCards and Visa cards in case shops require different kinds of payment. But technology that builds bridges between passes would not solve the problem that issuers would have to trust one another—and users would have to trust the adaptors fiddling with their health data. Perhaps, from the ashes of the pandemic, the world will devise a seamless digital vaccine passport that will replace the yellow card. But when covid is still killing thousands of people a week, the bickering over QR codes and digital signatures among multilateral organisations, tech groups and states is a sideshow, if not a distraction. Vaccine passports will never contain the virus. Only vaccines will. More than three-quarters of people in Denmark, Singapore and Qatar are fully vaccinated, according to Johns Hopkins University. Yet less than 1% of those in Ethiopia and Uganda are. Someday, vaccine passports might help keep the peace. But right now the world must focus on winning the war. ■ Dig deeper All our stories relating to the pandemic can be found on our coronavirus hub.

The latest order requires all health care professionals from across a range of fields to report their vaccination status to their respective colleges. Those colleges will then be required to share the information with the ministry, which will verify the information against their vaccination registry. According to a statement released on Monday night, Henry notified colleges regulating health professionals on March 4 that the order was to be posted shortly. “Under the order, registrants for whom vaccination status is not found must provide vaccinations records to their college by March 31, 2022. Colleges will be needed to disclose the vaccine status information of their registrants on request by the PHO or medical health officers,” the statement read.

Henry says the order, that has no expiry date, will not be reconsidered. In the order, Henry states that “to prevent or reduce the risk of the transmission of infection with (COVID-19) by health professionals I believe it is necessary for me to collect personal information about registrants at colleges.” Each college is responsible for gathering that information, which is then forwarded to the PHO and B.C. Ministry of Health. Advertisement 4 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.

The new order follows last month’s announcement when provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry said all regulated health professionals vaccinated with one dose before March 24 could continue to work only if they received a second dose within 35 days. The latest statement from the Health Ministry does not list any consequences for workers who refuse to share their vaccination status by the end of the month, and does not list any date for implementing any consequences for those who are not fully vaccinated. Last month, Henry said she was hopeful that vaccine hesitant people — including health workers — would take up the new Novavax vaccine as an alternative to mRNA vaccines like Pfizer and Moderna. —with files from Canadian Press Correction: An earlier version of this story stated that health care professionals would not be permitted to work beginning April 1, 2022, if not fully vaccinated.

      "The World Health Organization's Europe chief has warned countries against making COVID jabs a legal requirement after Austria revealed it was keeping the unvaccinated in lockdown. Hans Kluge said making vaccines a legal requirement risked damaging \"public confidence and public trust\" and are \"an absolute last resort\" after stricter regimes sparked protests across Europe. As the continued threat of Delta and rise of the Omicron variant raise the prospect of more COVID-19 restrictions around the world, Sky News looks at some of the strictest vaccine policies. Live COVID updates from the UK and around the world Austria Advertisement From 15 November, anyone unvaccinated in Austria has been banned from most public places, including restaurants, hotels, theatres and ski lifts. Austria came out of a two-week national lockdown on 5 December, which was intended to curb the recent wave of infections affecting western Europe. But the newly elected chancellor, Karl Nehammer, confirmed on 7 December that although society is opening up again, the unvaccinated will remain banned from the venues that had been closed and only allowed to leave home for essential reasons.

France announced this week that it will require people have a special virus pass before they can travel by plane, train or bus across the country. The Canadian government is also requiring vaccinations for all federal public servants in the country. The Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs Dominic Leblanc noted the federal government is the largest employer in the country. Leblanc said it is the government's duty to guarantee the safety of their employees and those who they serve. Canada has one of the highest vaccination rates in the world. Alghabra said additional measures are need to encourage more people to get vaccinated and to protect the hard won gains the country has made to flatten the epidemic curve. Cases are starting to creep up again in what Canada's top health official dubbed a fourth wave this week.

      "A raft of new measures have come into force to try and prevent the spread of the new strain (Picture: Zuma Press) Boris Johnson has announced a raft of new measures to combat the Omicron variant of coronavirus. Face masks are once again compulsory in shops and on public transport, while all travellers returning to the UK must take a PCR test and self-isolate until a negative result comes back. All close contacts of suspected Omicron cases must also self-isolate for 10 days, regardless of their age or vaccination status. The booster vaccine programme has also been massively expanded, with the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) now advising that all adults aged 18 and over should be offered a top-up dose. But the Prime Minister has been accused of not going far enough, with Labour and the devolved administrations in Scotland and Wales calling for even tougher measures. Despite the emergence of the worrying new strain, Health Secretary Sajid Javid said at the weekend that it was ‘nowhere near’ time for the reintroduction of social distancing rules and work-from-home guidance. So, what new rules have come into force, and how will you be affected? Here is everything you need to know. What are the new rules on face masks? Face masks will be compulsory on trains, buses and tubes, as well as in settings such as shops, banks and post offices from 4am on Tuesday. Face masks are once again compulsory in shops and on public transport (Picture: Ben Cawthra/LNP) It is also recommended that staff, visitors and pupils in Year 7 and above wear masks in communal areas in schools, colleges and universities such as corridors, canteens and halls. Though the reintroduction of masks in England in shops will bring the nation back closer into line with Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, they are not being required in pubs and restaurants. Full list of settings where face masks are now mandatory: shops and supermarkets (places that offer goods or services for retail sale or hire) shopping centres (malls and indoor markets) auction houses post offices, banks, building societies, credit unions, short-term loan providers, savings clubs and money service businesses estate and letting agents premises providing personal care and beauty treatments (barbers, hair salons, tattoo and piercing studios, nail salons, massage centres) pharmacies premises providing veterinary services retail galleries retail travel agents takeaways without space for consumption of food or drink on premises public transport (aeroplanes, trains, trams and buses), taxis and private hire vehicles any car, van or HGV, during a professional driving lesson, a formal driving test, or during one of the practical tests for giving driving instruction How will the new rules be enforced? The National Police Chiefs’ Council has said officers will enforce the regulations ‘where it is necessary to do so’. Police presence will be increased ‘where possible in high-risk and crowded areas, such as towns and shopping centres, and near transport hubs’, they added. Police can now issue fines of £200 – doubling with every further offence to reach a maximum of £6,400 – if they are not worn (Picture: Getty) If they encounter someone without a face covering, ‘they will engage with them, explain the risks and encourage them to comply with the new rules’. Police can now issue fines of £200 – doubling with every further offence to reach a maximum of £6,400 – if they are not worn. What have the supermarkets said about it? Shop workers are said to be ‘extremely concerned’ about any abuse they might experience while trying to police the use of face masks in store. The UK’s supermarkets have said they are waiting for advice from the Government and will be keeping their staff and customers informed. A Sainsbury’s spokeswoman said: ‘We are reviewing the latest Government guidance and will keep customers and colleagues updated.’ Morrisons said: ‘We will be following all updated Government guidelines to keep our customers and colleagues safe.’ Aldi also confirmed that face masks for all – except those who are medically exempt – will be compulsory from Tuesday. What are the new travel rules? From 4am on Tuesday, fully-vaccinated people entering the UK will be required to self-isolate until they receive a negative result from a PCR test taken on the second day after they arrive. The tests must be bought from the private sector, typically costing around £55. Previously, fully-vaccinated travellers were only required to take a cheaper lateral flow test, and did not need to self-isolate unless they received a positive result. All travellers returning to the UK must take a PCR test and self-isolate until a negative result comes back (Picture: AP) People who are unvaccinated will continue to need one pre-departure test and two post-arrival PCR tests and must quarantine for 10 days. Ten African countries – Angola, Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Zambia and Zimbabwe – have been added to the UK’s red list since Friday. Arrivals from those locations must stay in a quarantine hotel for 10 days at a cost of £2,285 for solo travellers. Those who breach the new rules can be fined between £500 and £10,000. When can I get my booster vaccine? Millions more people are now eligible for a booster jab after the programme was expanded in a huge push to beat the Omicron variant. Mr Javid announced yesterday that all over-18s can book in for their third dose, with the six-month gap after a second jab being halved to three. Those aged 12 to 15 will also be offered a second dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine, no sooner than 12 weeks after their first dose. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) also said that severely immunosuppressed people should be offered a fourth jab no sooner than three months after completing their primary course of three doses. Health Secretary Sajid Javid told the Commons he accepted the JCVI advice in full, adding: ‘With this new variant on the offensive these measures will protect more people more quickly and make us better protected as a nation.’ Will schools close early for Christmas? Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi has said that closing schools is the last possible option in the fight against the new variant. Mr Zahawi said he does not support the return of ‘bubbles’ in schools – where whole classes or year groups could be sent home after a positive Covid-19 test – as it reduces attendance ‘significantly’. His comments came as targeted testing of pupils began in two schools in Essex and Nottinghamshire after cases of the Omicron variant were detected in the local areas. Face masks are being recommended in communal areas of England’s secondary schools and colleges (Picture: AFP via Getty) Face masks are being recommended in communal areas of England’s secondary schools and colleges, but teaching unions are calling for tougher measures to be implemented to stop the spread of coronavirus. The Education Secretary told ITV’s This Morning programme: ‘The best place for children to be is in a classroom, learning.’ Asked if closing schools was the ‘last possible option’, he said: ‘Absolutely.’ The Health Secretary has also said: ‘There are no plans that I am aware of that would require us to close schools early, I think that would be very detrimental to the education of children.’ What about nativity plays? The Government is not asking schools to cancel nativity plays in the coming weeks despite the emergence of the new Omicron variant of coronavirus, a minister has said. Health minister Edward Argar said festive plays in school are ‘important to young people who’ve had a rough time’ during the Covid-19 pandemic. His comments came as a poll suggested that more than one in four (27%) primary school teachers have said their school is only planning to run nativity shows online this year. A poll by Teacher Tapp, of 1,711 primary school teachers in England, shared with the PA news agency, found that 10% said their primary school is not planning to host any nativity play this year. And what about Christmas parties? There are no legal restrictions on holding Christmas parties, while there are no requirements to produce vaccine passports and the new rules on face masks do not extend to hospitality venues. Speaking at the weekend, before six more cases of the Omicron variant were found in Scotland and two more were detected in England, Mr Javid said families should plan for a great Christmas ‘as normal’. Sorry, this video isn't available any more. He said it ‘would be irresponsible to make guarantees’ during the ever-changing pandemic, but he told Sky’s Trevor Phillips on Sunday: ‘I think people should continue with their plans as normal for Christmas, I think it’s going to be a great Christmas.’ Meanwhile, Mr Argar has said the Government will let people in England ‘use their judgments’ about whether to attend festive gatherings this year. Voluntary Government guidance advises people should wear masks in crowded and enclosed spaces where you come into contact with people you don’t normally meet, and take a lateral flow test before socialising with other people. Could the rules be tightened further? Although the Government has so far resisted calls to implement its ‘Plan B’ for dealing with coronavirus over the winter months, additional measures such as vaccine passports for nightclubs and stadiums do remain in reserve. Scotland’s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon and Wales’s First Minister, Mark Drakeford, have called for urgent talks with the Prime Minister over the new variant, and demanded that a tougher four-nations approach is adopted. Downing Street rejected calls from Ms Sturgeon and Mr Drakeford for the self-isolation period for travellers to be extended until the result of a test on day eight after arriving in the UK. Extending the requirements would have a ‘detrimental effect’ on the travel industry, No 10 said. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have all implemented travel rules for non-red list arrivals. England is also the only UK nation where working from home is not encouraged. Ms Sturgeon reminded people on Monday to ‘work from home if possible’. The advice is the same in Northern Ireland and working from home is encouraged under current guidance in Wales. On Monday the PM’s spokesman said it was up to employers to decide on the ‘right balance’ for them, when it came to whether staff worked from home or the office. The current measures will last three weeks and will be reviewed before they expire on December 20. That means they could be scrapped, extended or strengthened in time for Christmas.

Strict border rules are sending a negative message to travellers. Canada seems closed to conventions and major events. What we need is a harmonization of (travel) rules with the US.” Advertisement 4 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content The change is welcome news, just in time for the tourist season, according to Perrin Beatty, president of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce and co-chair of the Canadian Travel and Tourism Roundtable. “We’ve seen the collapse of our international tourism and convention business over the course of the last two years, and were on the cusp of losing the summer tourist season as well,” Beatty told The Canadian Press. He said anything the government can do to remove friction at the border will help convince people to come to Canada rather than go elsewhere. It’ll also make it easier for Canadians to return home after an international getaway this summer, Beatty said. 3:15 p.m. Rise in cases puts Germany’s Freedom Day in jeopardy Advertisement 5 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content From The Daily Telegraph: Plans for a coronavirus “Freedom Day” are under threat in Germany as infections are rising rapidly. The government intends to lift almost all remaining national restrictions on Sunday. But several regions have said they will keep many of the measures in place as the country recorded almost 200,000 new infections Tuesday. Germany still has tough lockdown restrictions in place weeks after the UK and other European countries lifted theirs. Proof of vaccination or a negative test is required to enter restaurants and pubs, and masks are still compulsory in all public indoor areas. Children are required to take regular tests to attend school and nurseries. The government earmarked March 20 as Germany’s Freedom Day several weeks ago, in light of the lower threat from the omicron variant, and pledged to lift all measures except a mask requirement on public transport and in health facilities. Advertisement 6 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content But a sharp rise in cases, culminating in Monday’s record 198,888 new infections in just 24 hours, has triggered opposition to the plans from figures including Karl Lauterbach, the health minister. “Germany now has the highest coronavirus incidence in Europe,” Lauterbach said. “Too many think the pandemic is over because omicron is harmless. That’s wrong – 200 people die a day and the trend is rising. Therefore there can be no Freedom Day.” Supporters of the government plans say deaths and hospital admissions are far lower than last year and the restrictions are no longer justified because the health system is not under threat. Currently, 2,226 intensive care beds are occupied by COVID patients, compared with 4,773 on Dec 3, when Germany was in the grip of the delta variant.

Liberal Leader Dominique Anglade says the Coalition Avenir Québec government is trying to keep many of the powers it gave itself during the crisis – including the power to give out no-bid contracts for five years. “Once again, (Premier) François Legault wants to govern alone and retain all his power until December 2022,” she said. “It’s appalling.” Vincent Marissal, the Québec solidaire health critic, said Dubé’s bill is nothing “but a deception to deceive people and oppositions.” Marissal added: “Let us be clear: Québec solidaire, like everyone else, wants to end the state of emergency. But if the government refuses to put in place measures to ensure accountability and a transparent transition towards exiting the pandemic, it will cross paths with us.” Advertisement 8 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.

Article content 1:15 p.m. Quebec doesn’t expect sixth wave until at least August or September, Dubé says Parts of Asia and Europe are currently seeing a sharp rise in COVID-19 cases, but Quebec experts say the province will only face a risk of a sixth wave in August or September, Health Minister Christian Dubé says. He made the comments after a reporter asked if Quebec expects a sixth wave of COVID. “It’s a possibility but it’s a possibility that we can manage right now,” Dubé answered. He said Quebec public health officials are monitoring the situation elsewhere. “They’re very clear” that “we’re OK” at the moment for several reasons, Dubé said. He noted many Quebecers obtained some immunity via infection during the Omicron wave, the province has a high vaccination rate, and the disease tends to abate as the weather improves. Advertisement 16 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content “But they say also that if there is a risk, the risk is in August or September,” Dubé said. “What we’ve learned during the last five waves is that we need to be ready,” he said, adding that’s why the government has to retain some emergency powers until the end of the year. Earlier, Dubé tabled a bill in the National Assembly to drop the state of emergency that has been in place since the start of the pandemic. However, “certain operational measures” will be maintained, he said. “They are essential but they are temporary.” These measures, which will be in place until Dec. 31, will allow Quebec to “remain agile” in case there’s a sixth wave, Dubé said. The bill would allow the government to, among other things, hire temporary employees when needed – and extend contracts related to vaccination and testing clinics and the storage and transportation of pandemic-related material.

Article content Dubé said that once the bill is passed, the Quebec government could not reimpose mask mandates and the vaccine passport – unless it declared a new state of emergency. However, he indicated that the public health department could decide to re-impose those measures. The mask mandate is the only remaining pandemic restriction in place in Quebec. The government has said it plans to lift mask requirements by mid-April in all spaces apart from public transit. Dubé said Quebec’s interim public health director, Dr. Luc Boileau, will consider in the coming days whether to recommend a fourth vaccine for “vulnerable people, maybe during the summer.” We apologize, but this video has failed to load. tap here to see other videos from our team.

The federal government will reportedly announce the change tomorrow. The Canadian Press says a source in the federal government confirmed the plan. Since Feb. 28, vaccinated travellers no longer need a molecular COVID-19 test to enter Canada and instead can opt for a rapid antigen test approved by the country they are coming from.

It says Quebec should “recognize long COVID as an illness that can lead to disability under the terms of the Régie des Rentes du Québec,” which would allow “financial support and related employment protections to be granted.” First reported in the spring of 2020, long COVID commonly refers to when people continue to experience symptoms — from cognitive issues to debilitating fatigue — weeks or months after contracting COVID-19. The World Health Organization says “current evidence suggests approximately 10 per cent to 20 per cent of people experience a variety of mid- and long-term effects after they recover from their initial illness.” Advertisement 23 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.

Advertisement 5 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content Seven other countries – South Africa, Namibia, Zimbabwe, Botswana, Lesotho, Mozambique and Eswatini – have been targeted by the same restriction since Friday. All travellers who have visited any of the 10 countries and arrived in Canada over the past 14 days will have to quarantine, get tested and stay in isolation until they have a negative test. That applies to the vaccinated and unvaccinated alike. Speaking at a late afternoon federal briefing in Ottawa, Health Minister Jean-Yves Duclos also announced all air travellers coming from outside Canada – apart from the United States – will now have to be tested at the airport at which they land in Canada. The screening applies to all, whether vaccinated or not. Travellers will have to isolate themselves until they get results. Advertisement 6 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content Duclos said airport testing will begin “quickly…over the next few days. Obviously, that cannot take place immediately everywhere at the same speed but we have full confidence in the system.” Transport Minister Omar Alghabra said the “testing measures will allow us to assess the evolving situation and determine any additional appropriate measures.” Alghabra had a warning for people planning trips: Canadians “thinking about travelling (should) recognize that travel measures could change at any moment.” Duclos said Ottawa is talking to the provinces before deciding whether it could or should also require people arriving by land or air from the U.S. to be tested upon arrival. The minister also announced he has asked the National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) whether guidance on COVID-19 vaccination booster shots guidance should be revised in light of the Omicron variant.

Article content 2:35 p.m. BioNTech says vaccine likely to protect against severe COVID from Omicron, but Moderna boss foresees a drop in protection From the Reuters news agency: BioNTech and Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine will likely offer strong protection against any severe disease from the new Omicron virus variant, BioNTech’s chief executive says, as the firm weighs the need to upgrade its commonly used shot. Lab tests are underway over the next two weeks to analyze the blood of people who had two or three doses of BioNTech’s Comirnaty vaccine to see if antibodies found in that blood inactivate Omicron, shedding light on whether new vaccines are needed. “We think it’s likely that people will have substantial protection against severe disease caused by Omicron,” said BioNTech CEO and co-founder Ugur Sahin. He specified severe disease as requiring hospital or intensive care. Advertisement 12 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content Sahin added he expects the lab tests to show some loss of vaccine protection against mild and moderate disease due to Omicron, but the extent of that loss was hard to predict. The biotech firm is speedily working on an upgraded version of its vaccine, of which well over 2 billion doses have been delivered, although it remains unclear whether that is needed, he added. Sahin said getting a third vaccine shot known as a booster will likely confer a layer of protection against Omicron infections of any severity compared to those with just a two-shot course. “To my mind, there’s no reason to be particularly worried. The only thing that worries me at the moment is the fact that there are people that have not been vaccinated at all,” Sahin added. Advertisement 13 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content BioNTech’s guarded confidence contrasts with a sense of alarm conveyed by the chief executive of rival vaccine maker Moderna, Stephane Bancel, who has raised the prospect of a material drop in protection against the new coronavirus lineage from current vaccines. “There is no world, I think, where (the effectiveness) is the same level . . . we had with Delta,” Bancel told the Financial Times. “I think it’s going to be a material drop. I just don’t know how much because we need to wait for the data. But all the scientists I’ve talked to . . .are like ‘this is not going to be good’.” 2:30 p.m. FAQ: What we know so far about the Omicron variant From The Canadian Press: The Omicron COVID-19 variant — which may be more transmissible — was first identified in South Africa, where it coincided with a recent spike in cases, but it’s unclear where it first emerged. Here’s what we know about it so far: Advertisement 14 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content What is Omicron? Omicron is a new variant of COVID-19 that was designated a “variant of concern” by the World Health Organization last week. The U.N. health agency also gave the variant its name, following a classification system based on the Greek alphabet. The WHO said the variant has “a large number of mutations, some of which are concerning,” and preliminary evidence suggests it has an increased risk of reinfection. Canada’s chief public health officer, Dr. Theresa Tam, said Friday that some of the mutations detected show a potential for greater transmissibility, and could reduce natural immunity as well as the immunity offered by vaccines. Where has it been found? Outside South Africa, Omicron cases have been confirmed in a growing number of countries. Canada, the Netherlands, Israel, Australia, Germany, Belgium, the United Kingdom and Hong Kong are among those that have reported cases. Advertisement 15 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content Spain confirmed its first case Monday, in a traveller who arrived from South Africa. Portuguese health authorities, meanwhile, have identified 13 cases of Omicron in members of a top soccer club, and are investigating possible local transmission of the variant. That would be the first reported instance of local transmission outside of southern Africa. Dutch health authorities said Tuesday that the Omicron variant was already in the Netherlands when South Africa reported it to the World Health Organization last week. They said the variant was detected in samples dating from Nov. 19 and 23. Canada’s first two cases, confirmed in Ottawa, are in people who recently returned from Nigeria. Two more cases were confirmed in Ottawa on Monday night, and two more possible cases are being investigated in the Hamilton region. Ontario’s top doctor said Monday it would not be surprising to see more cases, adding the province is performing genome sequencing on all eligible positive COVID-19 tests in order to help detect the variant. Advertisement 16 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content Public health units in Ontario are also offering tests to 375 people who recently returned from countries Canada considers at high risk for the variant. Quebec confirmed its first Omicron case on Monday. What is Canada doing? Canada announced last week it is no longer allowing visitors from southern Africa in an effort to limit the spread of the Omicron variant. The ban applies to foreign nationals who have been in seven listed countries over the past 14 days, including South Africa, Mozambique, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Lesotho, Namibia and Eswatini. Nigeria — where several confirmed Canadian cases had been — is not on the list. Travellers who transited through the listed countries and are already in Canada must quarantine and be tested for COVID-19. Ottawa has also issued an advisory discouraging non-essential travel to South Africa and nearby countries.

Article content Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Tuesday that Canada is watching the Omicron situation very closely. “There may be more we need to do and we’ll be looking at it very carefully,” he said. Public Safety Minister Marco Mendicino said Tuesday that the best available scientific and medical evidence will inform the government’s decisions. Opposition parties and some provincial leaders have been pressing Ottawa to enact strict border measures. Ontario’s top doctor said the province wants testing for all returning travellers, regardless of where they came from. How effective are COVID-19 vaccines against Omicron? That isn’t yet clear, but vaccine manufacturers are looking into it. 2 p.m. ‘We will listen to public health’ on Christmas gatherings, Legault says Premier François Legault is defending his decision on Monday to raise the prospect of much larger family gatherings this Christmas even though cases are rising, the Omicron variant looms and public health has yet to weigh in on the issue. Advertisement 18 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content At a press conference on Tuesday, a reporter asked if he went too far, noting that critics are accusing him of raising expectations and potentially causing confusion. In response, Legault said the current restriction on gatherings in private homes – a maximum of 10 people are allowed – is too restrictive to allow large families to get together. “I would like to be able to increase it to 20 or 25 but I clearly stated yesterday and I’ll state it again today: we will listen to the recommendations from public health,” Legault said. Dr. Horacio Arruda, Quebec’s public health director, has said he will not announce his guidelines for Christmas gatherings before Dec. 6. Legault added: “My objective would be to allow Quebecers to go up to 20 or 25 in homes.” We apologize, but this video has failed to load. tap here to see other videos from our team.

Article content 12:30 p.m. Opposition blasts Legault for mixed messages on Christmas gatherings With cases rising and uncertainty over the impact of a potentially difficult new variant, Quebec is sending mixed messages about the size of Christmas gatherings this year. And opposition parties at the National Assembly are urging Premier François Legault to resist the urge to raise expectations. On Monday, Health Minister Christian Dubé and public-health director Dr. Horacio Arruda sounded cautious in the wake of the sudden arrival of the variant, known as Omicron. A few hours later, Premier François Legault raised the prospect that Quebec could loosen restrictions for gatherings in homes before Christmas. At a pandemic briefing, Dubé and Arruda said whether restrictions on gatherings in homes are tightened, loosened or stay the same will depend on the epidemiological situation and what scientists discover about Omicron – specifically whether it is more contagious and how effective vaccines are against it. Advertisement 22 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content Arruda said Quebec will not announce holiday guidelines before Dec. 6. Dubé stressed the importance of continuing to follow pandemic measures. Many Quebecers “think the health crisis is behind us but we see that unfortunately, it’s not,” the minister said. “And I remind everybody that gatherings in houses are still limited to 10 people. And that’s important because we see that many cases come from that. It’s (also) not permitted to rent a chalet to have a Christmas party – the rule is the same: 10 people maximum.” Dubé also urged Quebecers to think twice before booking international travel because rules regarding re-entry into Canada could be tightened due to the Omicron threat. Legault later offered a more optimistic outlook. Advertisement 23 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content “Personally, I hope to get the OK so that during the holiday season we are able to increase to 20 to 25” the allowed number of people at holiday gatherings of friends and family, Legault said. “But for now, I will listen to the recommendations of public health.” Legault was speaking to reporters at the inauguration of the Club Med Québec Charlevoix in Petite-Rivière-Saint-François. Opposition parties today criticized the Coalition Avenir Québec government for the conflicting messages. “What is the rationale, what is the need to create expectations many weeks in advance? It’s exactly what was done a year ago, when we told people that Christmas would be great, only to backtrack afterwards,” said Parti Québécois Leader Paul St-Pierre Plamondon. “We need to stop doing that.” Advertisement 24 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content Liberal House Leader André Fortin said: “We want the opinions of public health to be clear on this issue, to be available as soon as they are confirmed or finalized… What is problematic is that on the same day the health minister says ‘Pay attention, the rule is 10 people’… the premier publicly says that he would like it to be 20 or 25.” Fortin added: “If we want the rules to be respected, we can’t just throw wishes in the air like that. This is what creates confusion among Quebecers, this is what creates uncertainty about the rules. So I would like the premier to show the same diligence as his health minister.” Québec solidaire spokesperson Gabriel Nadeau-Dubois said Legault is “playing a dangerous game.” He added: “I do not understand this habit of François Legault to launch test balloons, to raise hopes which could lead to disappointment later. We must not play with people’s mental health. We must not play with their hopes of finally having a beautiful Christmas.” We apologize, but this video has failed to load. tap here to see other videos from our team.

      "“I HOPE YOU never have to see it like this again,” says Markus Quint, communications chief for Frankfurt’s Messe (exhibition centre), as he surveys 440,000 square metres of empty halls from a 22nd-floor terrace. When the pandemic struck last spring the Messe, which had welcomed nearly 2.5m visitors in 2019, had to shut for all business bar the digital sort. Worldwide revenues (the Messe has 29 subsidiaries) plunged from €736m ($870m) to €257m. Most of the 1,000-odd Frankfurt staff went on Kurzarbeitergeld, Germany’s much-imitated furlough scheme. Listen to this story. Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or Android Your browser does not support the element. Listen to this story Save time by listening to our audio articles as you multitask OK As Germans prepare to go to the polls on September 26th, recovery is glinting. Mr Quint says he could have “cried with joy” in July when the Messe reopened for its first physical exhibition, a trade fair for bike-part manufacturers. Bigger shows are in the works, including a return of the famous Frankfurt Book Fair next month. Yet the threat from covid-19 has not evaporated. In the Messe’s case, border restrictions and quarantine rules make it near-impossible for what was once a large contingent of Asian and American visitors to attend the shows. Other businesses fear the return of some contact restrictions amid a fourth wave of infections and Germany’s worryingly low vaccination rate. Hiccups in supply chains present a more serious drag on Germany’s recovery, says Clemens Fuest of the Ifo Institute in Munich. The global semiconductor shortage is crippling Germany’s mighty carmakers. Fully 70% of all German manufacturers say they are running low on everything from aluminium to paper. Highly globalised Germany—its total trade was equivalent to 88% of GDP in 2019—is particularly exposed. Having previously forecast that the economy would reach its pre-crisis level at the end of 2021, Ifo has grown more pessimistic. No wonder German firms are watching the election campaign with keen interest—and in some cases grave concern. Jürgen Vormann, CEO of Infraserv Höchst, a chemicals-service provider based in Frankfurt, says he fears that the next government will be zealous about climate change and so wrap business in red tape. Germany’s electricity prices, Europe’s highest, are a huge burden on industry. Some of Germany’s influential family businesses fear tax raids. “You need not be a pessimist to anticipate that we’re going in the wrong direction,” says Mr Vormann. In consensus-oriented Germany, none of the likely coalition configurations will bring economic rupture. But differences between the party platforms will make for tricky post-election negotiations, especially as polls suggest that only ideologically muddled three-way coalitions will be viable. The pro-business Free Democrats ( FDP ) and the conservative Christian Democratic bloc ( CDU / CSU ), for example, vow not to increase the tax burden, whereas the Social Democrats ( SPD ) and the Greens want a wealth tax and higher income taxes on the rich. All parties agree on the need to speed up climate protection, but differ strongly on the balance between market mechanisms and regulation. This problem will interact with a more familiar one: the parties’ sums do not add up. The German Economic Institute ( IW ) reckons that by 2025 growing demands on the state-pension system, extra defence spending and a few other fresh expenses could reach a cumulative €263bn. But of the main parties, only the Greens have made pledges that they say will be revenue-neutral. The FDP ’s tax cuts could add €75bn, roughly 2% of GDP , to the deficit. No party’s manifesto will survive coalition talks. But Germany’s constitutional brake on public debt, which took effect in 2016, limits annual deficits to 0.35% of GDP . All main parties bar the Greens say they wish to abide by it, yet growth alone will not generate enough cash to do so. Parties always make dodgy claims on taxation and spending, says Thomas Obst of the IW . He is more alarmed by their failure to confront Germany’s demographic challenges. As the baby-boomers retire en masse throughout the 2020s, subsidies to the pension system, which already gobbles up 30% of the federal budget, will rocket in the absence of reform. At a televised debate on September 12th only Armin Laschet, the CDU / CSU candidate, acknowledged the urgency of the problem. Olaf Scholz, the SPD frontrunner, brushed it aside, placing his faith in expanding the labour force. Another test will be to meet the investment demands presented by Germany’s climate targets, including extending power grids and insulating buildings. The private sector can take up much of the slack; revamping Germany’s planning rules and municipal working practices will help. But some estimates put the demand on the federal budget at close to €50bn a year. If that also seems incompatible with the constraints of the debt brake, there may be room for a political fix. True, the tweak to the brake sought by the Greens is a non-starter, as it needs a two-thirds majority in each of the two parliamentary chambers. And months before the European Commission is due to begin a review of the EU ’s fiscal rules, the CDU / CSU fears that assenting to German profligacy now could encourager les autres (see Charlemagne). But most parties would probably stomach what Mr Obst calls the “second-best solution” of establishing off-budget investment funds that could circumvent the debt brake. And there are signs of a subtle shift. Some CDU / CSU figures have upset colleagues by questioning the rigidity of the debt brake in an era of cheap money and pressing investment needs. And while the FDP remains committed to it, Christian Lindner, the party’s leader, has lately emphasised that he is not ideologically wedded to a balanced budget—a move interpreted as an overture to the SPD , currently leading the polls, and the Greens. The trio could assemble a left-leaning “traffic-light” coalition—the most plausible outcome if current polling is borne out on election day. That illustrates a broader shift in Germany’s economic debate. “Everyone knows that we have to transform Germany…and for digitalisation and decarbonisation, it’s all about investment,” says Otto Fricke, an FDP budget expert. The divisions between parties on budgetary planning, monetary policy and European spending seem less rigid than in the past. The public debate is more tolerant of what used to be outlandish views. As ever, the theatrics of the campaign before the election will not preclude the compromises that will, eventually, be made after it. ■ For more coverage of the German elections, visit our dedicated hub\n",

      "A legal challenge is to be launched against the mandatory COVID pass policy in Wales. Civil liberties campaign group Big Brother Watch is seeking a judicial review of a scheme it described as \"draconian, discriminatory and pointless\". The NHS COVID pass was introduced in Wales in October, and allows people to prove they are vaccinated or have had a negative lateral flow test so they can attend large events or venues. People attending cinemas, concert halls, theatres, nightclubs and other large events, are required to present a COVID pass. Image: Boris Johnson walks past a poster advertising the NHS COVID Pass during a visit to a vaccination centre The Welsh Government said they were brought in to \"keep businesses open while also helping to control the spread of the virus and protect the NHS\". Advertisement But Big Brother Watch said the reasons behind the scheme \"don't stand up to scrutiny\" and wants full disclosure of the documents and advice that led Welsh ministers to impose the measure. The group claims it creates \"significant and far-reaching\" rights interferences. It has also begun a legal challenge against the COVID pass scheme in England, and is urging the UK government to scrap the English scheme by the end of January. The group's director Silkie Carlo said: \"We support proportionate measures to protect public health, but there is exceptionally weak evidence supporting the role of COVID passes. \"We're calling on the Welsh government to disclose the documents and advice they say they're relying on to impose the COVID pass scheme on people in Wales. Their refusal to do so raises suspicions that the government's case is weak or non-existent. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 6:58 Conservative MP Tobias Ellwood: COVID passports for big indoor events are 'illogical' \"The reluctance to be transparent now even extends to an unwillingness to consent to Big Brother Watch publishing the legal papers from its own claim, presumably because they quote from correspondence that attempts to justify the scheme. \"If COVID passes are having no noticeable effect on public health in Wales, as appears to be the case, there is simply no justification for them. Mandatory COVID IDs are a disproportionate intrusion of medical privacy, an erosion of freedom and a threat to equality.\" Shirin Marker, the Bindmans solicitor representing the group, said: \"It is also important that the legal process on a matter of public interest like this is transparent, which is why we are seeking the court's permission to allow Big Brother Watch to fully publish details of its claim.\" A Welsh government spokesperson said: \"The COVID pass has been introduced as one measure - among many - to help keep businesses open while also helping to control the spread of the virus and protect the NHS. \"The venues where the COVID pass is required have been chosen because they are mostly indoors and they see large numbers of people congregating closely together for prolonged periods of time. As we know, the longer large numbers of people are close together, especially indoors, the greater the risk of transmission. \"A stakeholder group were kept informed of plans and decisions. We continue to support businesses that are required by law to ask for a COVID pass with a range of advice and guidance.\"\n",

The number of hospitalizations is still very high and will maybe continue to increase in the next few days.” Earlier in the day, new provincial modelling was published showing Quebec could see a slowdown in the growth of COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations over the next few weeks.

Legault was asked what he would tell students who may have fears related to the return to classrooms. “There is no such thing as zero risk in life but after speaking with public health, it’s very clear to me that there are more advantages to returning to school than to staying at home,” he answered.

Dr. Luc Boileau, Quebec’s interim public health director, was asked about the risks of reopening schools. He conceded that “there will be a lot of cases in schools” but said they are not expected to lead to a rise in hospitalizations. Boileau, who took over from Dr. Horacio Arruda this week, also addressed teachers’ demands for better protection via N95 masks. Would they be better protected with such masks? “I don’t think so,” he answered, citing analyses by Quebec experts. “In school settings, there is no reason to believe that there would be an advantage” over other types of masks.

The measure has been dubbed an “anti-vax tax.” He said some will be exempt, including people living with homelessness, those with mental health issues, as well as people with valid medical reasons for not getting vaccinated. Government lawyers are still working on the bill, Legault said. He added: “What will it be called? Will it be a fine, will it be a contribution? In the end, there will be an amount to be paid by people who without a good reason refuse to get vaccinated.” Be patient on reopening restaurants, gyms: Dubé Health Minister Christian Dubé was asked about people who are impatient to see the reopening of restaurants and gyms.

Quebec has signed a deal with a company that is to supply 70 million rapid tests, Legault announced. Education Minister Jean-François Roberge said Quebec will distribute 3.6 million tests to parents with children in daycares and elementary schools, starting next week. Daycares and schools will also have rapid tests on hand in case children or staff show symptoms. Legault was asked about the fact that Ontario is ahead of Quebec on administering third doses. In response, the premier conceded that Ontario’s booster rollout was better planned. But he added that Quebec did a better job on second doses.

Article content The dispatch of 1,000 military health personnel is “part of a major deployment of our nation’s armed forces to help hospitals across the country manage this surge of the Omicron virus,” Biden said. “I know we’re all frustrated as we enter this new year,” Biden said, while reiterating his message that COVID-19 continues to be a “pandemic of the unvaccinated.” U.S. COVID-19 hospitalizations reached a record high this week after steadily increasing since late December, according to a Reuters tally, while Omicron overtook Delta as the dominant variant of the coronavirus. The U.S. will send the health workers, in teams of seven to 25 military doctors, nurses and other personnel, to Michigan, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Ohio and Rhode Island to support at-capacity emergency rooms and free up overwhelmed hospital staff for non-COVID cases, the White House said earlier on Thursday.

Article content The White House’s more aggressive stance comes after months of criticism from health experts that the administration was relying too heavily on vaccines alone to stop the spread of the coronavirus, especially given a politically motivated anti-vaccine movement pushed by some Republican officials. About 62 per cent of Americans are considered fully vaccinated, according to U.S. data. Federal Emergency Management Agency Administrator Deanne Criswell, who joined Biden during his speech, told CNN earlier “the number one request continues to be staffing,” referring to states asking for federal aid. Other states are likely to need reinforcements of military and other federal doctors and nurses as well, she said.

The trials did not check for a reduction in “cases” as measured by positive SARS-CoV-2 tests without symptoms, nor in COVID-19 hospitalizations or deaths. They also did not attempt to understand the impact of the vaccines on transmission. The interim authorization of the vaccines was based on their efficacy in reducing what amounts to cold symptoms in the vaccinated person. Advertisement 3 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content Since the start of the mass vaccinations, researchers worldwide have examined whether vaccination does reduce the spread of COVID as a positive side effect. While it seems plausible that such an effect might occur, the results are meagre. Some studies found modest reductions in the spread of the original SARS-CoV-2 variant, a far cry from “stopping” transmission. With the Delta variant, the effect has further shrunk and in a CDC-funded study, vaccinated individuals carried similar viral loads as the unvaccinated.

Article content Meanwhile, the province of Ontario with over 70% twice-vaccinated people is preparing for a fourth wave and already has significantly more cases, hospitalizations and deaths than one year ago, when nobody was vaccinated. So, what is a vaccine passport supposed to prove? What are vaccination mandates meant to achieve? Before Delta, vaccinated individuals may have been slightly less contagious than the unvaccinated. But with Delta, there does not appear to be a difference in spreading the virus. If anything, the vaccine works to protect the recipient. It is therefore nobody’s business to know whether another person is vaccinated or not. And there is no reason to expect, pressure or require another person to “take the jab.” The campaign to vaccinate children and young adults is particularly offensive, since they bear all the risks from short- and long-term adverse events and obtain no measurable benefits from the shot.

Article content In addition, people who had recovered from a SARS-CoV-2 infection were not recruited for the pharma companies’ phase II/III trials.

The country’s Prime Minister Jean Castex announced stricter measures Monday set to kick in next month in an attempt to fight the latest coronavirus variant sweeping Europe. Starting today, people in France will be able to get a booster shot after just three months following their initial jabs, Castex said. Home working will also be mandatory from January for at least three days a week, and large gatherings will be restricted. No shirt, no jab, no service: Under a proposed law also announced Monday, access to bars, restaurants and trains will be restricted for unvaccinated people, who have so far been able to enter such venues by showing proof of a negative test. Read more on POLITICO. BELGIUM CONSIDERS MANDATORY VACCINATION: Belgium is also considering new measures, with Prime Minister Alexander De Croo signaling a potential change of heart on mandatory vaccination, POLITICO’s Barbara Moens reports. **A message from Facebook: In the EU, more than 200 million people are members of Facebook Groups. By connecting people with like-minded, inspiring communities, Facebook’s apps are making it possible to transform lives and neighbourhoods.** The French-speaking socialists, who are part of De Croo’s government, had previously called for mandatory vaccination in Belgium, but De Croo had initially described such a step “political laziness.” Convincing facts: Over the weekend, however, he told the newspaper De Zondag in an interview that the situation for intensive care units is now making him reconsider: “The impact of a relatively small group on our healthcare is too big. We can not allow that to happen. Keynes, a British economist, once said: ‘When the facts change, I change my mind.’ Good arguments can convince me.” BUT ENGLAND IS HOLDING FIRE: England will be the only part of the U.K. where people can go clubbing on New Year’s Eve, after the government confirmed Monday it would not bring in new COVID restrictions this side of 2022 — in contrast to Scotland and Wales. US REDUCES RECOMMENDED QUARANTINE TIME: Also on Monday, U.S. health officials said those who test positive for COVID-19 and are asymptomatic need only isolate for five days, not 10, citing growing evidence that people are most infectious in the initial days after developing symptoms. Biden administration health officials had debated the policy shift in recent weeks, especially amid a surge in Omicron cases that has raised concerns about worker shortages and fueled calls to revisit quarantine guidelines. NEW CASES IN CHINA: Chinese authorities reported 162 new community infections on Monday, as the city of Xi’an tightened its super-strict lockdown. The city’s 13 million residents have been confined to their homes, with only one household member allowed to exit every second day to buy groceries. Omicron threatens Beijing’s strategy: The government is still pursuing a zero-COVID strategy — a policy that has severely disrupted travel to the country and global trade. There is no easy way out from this strategy for the government, amid disappointing data on the efficacy of China’s Sinovac vaccine, which according to the WHO has an efficacy of around 50 percent. What’s worse, even a third shot of the vaccine appears to be ineffective against the much more contagious Omicron variant. As the mainland still has not rolled out the more effective mRNA vaccines, it faces the unpalatable choice of either dropping its zero-COVID goal or maintaining draconian restrictions for a long time to come. Take Chinese data with a big pinch of salt: China has a country-wide ban on public communication on the coronavirus — which not only applies to media and online platforms, but also to scientists. No data or research can be published without prior authorization by the government, under direct orders from President Xi Jinping, according to internal documents obtained by the Associated Press. In other words: There is no independent data or monitoring, so beyond anecdotal reports, we don’t really know what’s going on — but reports from last year suggested actual cases were at least initially much higher than the government admitted. RULE OF LAW POLISH PRESIDENT DUDA VETOES MEDIA RESTRICTIONS: Polish President Andrzej Duda intervened to head off a clash with Washington on Monday by vetoing a controversial media law that was widely seen as targeting independent broadcaster TVN, owned by the U.S. media giant Discovery. Critical thinking: Under the ruling nationalist Law and Justice party (PiS), Poland has been repeatedly accused of backsliding on democratic and rule of law standards. Earlier this month, PiS unexpectedly rushed through legislation that would have forced Discovery out by insisting that broadcasters operating in Poland must be majority-owned by entities from the European Economic Area, therefore excluding the country’s biggest independent broadcaster. TVN is fiercely critical of the government and acts as a significant counterbalance to the public network TVP, which PiS has turned into an unadulterated propaganda channel, Wojciech Kość reports for POLITICO from Warsaw. Pick your battles: With the country already locked in a deteriorating rule of law dispute with Brussels, and Washington putting heavy pressure on Warsaw to throw out the legislation, Duda insisted his country did not need to open another war. “I share the opinion of most of my fellow countrymen whom I spoke to that we don’t need another disturbing or troubling issue [and] we do not need more disputes,” he said upon delivering his veto. Former Polish PM Donald Tusk also credited protesters who took the streets over the legislation and Washington for forcing Duda to pull the emergency brake. “Pressure makes sense,” he tweeted. “Let no one say anymore that it is not worth it, that it is impossible, that we cannot do anything. We can and we must.” Costly move: Duda also cautioned that arbitration over TVN’s rights could lead to Poland being sued for “billions of dollars” — maybe one of the first times that much-criticized, investor-state arbitration could have actually benefited public interests. Under the proposed law, Discovery would have had just six months to sell its controlling stake in TVN. PiS’ view: PiS Chairman Jarosław Kaczyński, who is Poland’s most powerful politician, said the law was not meant to interfere with press freedom. “We are concerned only with putting things in order and not with any attack on the free media. I know perfectly well that TVN will remain anti-government,” Kaczyński said. **Forthcoming Bills. Legislative Voting Records. Stakeholder Filings. Policy Amendments.

Disgraced former King Juan Carlos, who abdicated in 2014 and then fled Spain last year amid corruption investigations, has reportedly been spending time in his new home in Abu Dhabi with Abdul Rahman El Assir, a Spanish-Lebanese arms dealer who is wanted under an international arrest warrant, according to El País. Old friends reunite: According to the paper, the arms dealer, who has evaded justice in Spain and France, has been a frequent visitor at the luxury estate of Juan Carlos, whom he has known since the 1980s. “The relationship had cooled, but in the loneliness both of them faced in Abu Dhabi, it has strengthened again,” one unnamed person who is close to Juan Carlos told the newspaper. “It is a friendship of more than 30 years that no one has managed to avoid,” according to another person in his entourage. Friends with benefits: Juan Carlos’ daughters Elena and Cristina have also regularly visited him. On one of those occasions, the infantas were accused of skipping the line for coronavirus vaccines at home and getting the jab in the United Arab Emirates at a time when Europe was only vaccinating the most at-risk groups. LEVELING WHAT? Boris Johnson has been touting a pledge to “level up” Britain — but an exclusive poll shared with POLITICO suggests most voters don’t know what he’s talking about. The phrase is generally understood to refer to addressing regional inequalities, but the British prime minister has struggled to define its parameters beyond that. And the survey shows just a quarter of people say they know exactly what leveling up means, indicating Johnson has his work cut out if he wants his policies to truly resonate with voters. Esther Webber has the full story. REPORT — EU’S BELARUS SANCTIONS LACK TEETH: Many of the economic sanctions imposed by the EU on Belarus are ineffective, according to a new report by Germany’s Der Spiegel. Loopholes and circumvention: Sanctions on potassium fertilizers — which EU politicians touted as some of the toughest measures in the package of penalties — come with generous exemptions for products with potassium salt content of 40-62 percent. The report says these are exactly the types of salts big companies in the EU and Norway import from Belarus. Sanctions on oil products also seem less effective than the EU claimed, as oil exports to Estonia hit a record high in 2021, according to Belarusian news agency Belta. Meanwhile, Austrian timber company Kronospan this year announced it would start construction of its fourth factory in Belarus. BIG TECH’S BATTLE OVER BUILDING CARS: With companies like Google and Ford teaming up on new partnerships in automaking, industry watchdogs fear that tech companies will soon be doing to cars what they did to phones: Tying their exclusive operating systems to specific products to force out competitors and dominate a huge swath of the global economy. Now, having missed the boat as the tech giants cornered the market on smartphones, some policymakers and regulators believe the battle over connected cars represents a chance to block potential monopolies before they form.

      "British employers have been warned that forcing staff to have the coronavirus vaccination could amount to a criminal offence, amid concerns over \"no jab, no job\" policies emerging. Only care home staff in England will need to have both vaccine doses to work under current legislation, with a consultation taking place on whether to extend this to NHS employees. But in the US, tech giants Facebook and Google are among those to say their staff will have to show proof they have been fully vaccinated before returning to their workplaces.

Advertisement Advice from the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD) says \"mandatory vaccination is an intrusion on an employee's body and may discriminate on the basis of disability, or religious or philosophical belief.\" \"Employers cannot forcibly vaccinate employees or potential employees, unless they work in a sector (such as care homes) where a legal requirement is introduced,\" it states. \"Enforced vaccination would be a criminal offence against the person and an unlawful injury leading to claims such as assault and battery.\" The CIPD - which represents human resources professionals and has more than 160,000 members - adds that the European Convention on Human Rights \"protects people from being interfered with physically or psychologically (which includes mandatory vaccination)\". Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has suggested it is \"a good idea\" for people to be double jabbed before returning to the office but said it will not be required by legislation. He told Sky News: \"We are not going to make that legislation that every adult has to be double vaccinated before they go back to the office, but yes it is a good idea and yes some companies will require it.\" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 0:23 'Good idea' to get two jabs before returning to office - Shapps A government spokesperson told Sky News on Saturday: \"While we would welcome employers encouraging their staff to be vaccinated, employers who propose to check the vaccination status of staff will need to consider how this fits with their legal obligations under employment, equalities, data protection, and health and safety law.\" The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) has said it understands that firms will want to protect their staff and their customers by requiring employees to be vaccinated, but it advises them to take other factors into consideration. An EHRC spokesman said: \"Employers are right to want to protect their staff and their customers, particularly in contexts where people are at risk, such as care homes. \"However, requirements must be proportionate, non-discriminatory and make provision for those who cannot be vaccinated for medical reasons.\" Parliament approved legislation earlier this month to introduce compulsory COVID vaccinations for care home staff in England. Image: Care home staff in England will have to be fully vaccinated to work. Pic: AP From the autumn, anyone working in a Care Quality Commission-registered care home in England must have two doses of the vaccine unless they have a medical exemption. But the impact of such a policy on jobs is not fully understood by the government. Its own best estimate suggests around 40,000 care home staff risk being lost as a result of the compulsory vaccinations, adding that it could cost the industry £100m to replace. But the government is yet to compile a full impact assessment of the policy, something which frustrated several Tory MPs earlier this month when they discussed the issue.

However a number of Conservative MPs have told Sky News they do not think the government will follow through and actually introduce domestic vaccine passports. Sir Graham Brady, chairman of the 1922 Committee of backbench Tories, said that vaccine passports for domestic use would be a \"massive step and a misguided one\".\n",

      "Health minister Robin Swann has said he is concerned about public confusion over what Stormont ministers have agreed regarding the wearing of face coverings in nightclubs. The Executive has agreed that masks will not be mandatory for dancing in nightclubs when they reopen next Sunday. Mr Swann urged clubs which reopen to consider using vaccine certification as an entry requirement. What I am worried about is confusion in regards to the message that we have in regards to face coverings Robin Swann He was speaking at the Kingspan Stadium, the home of Ulster Rugby, which has become the location for a combined Covid vaccine booster and flu jab clinic for patients of Castlereagh Medical Centre. Mr Swann said: “What I am worried about is confusion in regards to the message that we have in regards to face coverings. Face coverings are still mandatory in Northern Ireland, should that be on public transport, in retail or in crowded places. “When it comes to a single message I am concerned that there has been some confusion established in regards to what was agreed, what was talked about.” There had been criticism of some of the relaxations agreed by the Executive, with Dr Tom Black, chair of BMA’s Northern Ireland council, describing them as “madness”.

People will also be able to move freely around hospitality premises from that date, including being able to stand at the bar for a drink. Responding to criticism of the Executive decisions, Mr Swann said: “I would ask people to look at the proportionate steps that the Executive has taken in regards to easing restrictions and we have always taken those at a time when we saw there was the ability to do that.

There is an option for any venue to take in guidance the utilisation of Covid vaccine certification or people having received a lateral flow test. I would encourage those venues that are opening up to look to that guidance that is there. “But also people who are going to nightclubs to be responsible as well. One of the things I would say to them is be responsible.” On Friday, Mr Swann warned that Northern Ireland’s health service is facing its most difficult winter ever as he detailed winter and Covid surge delivery plans in local health trusts.

It is 10 years of under-investment in our health service. That is not just in bricks and mortar, it is also in our workforce as well. “We are playing catch-up, not just in regards to that but we are playing catch-up while we combat what is still a global pandemic and virus. On a health service that was struggling to start with.” The minister also said he was delighted to see so many people turning up at the Kingspan Stadium to get their Covid booster and flu jabs. The Covid booster and flu vaccines have a vital role to play in protecting people this winter Dr Deirdre Savage Dr Deirdre Savage, GP at Castlereagh Medical Centre, said: “We are very grateful to Ulster Rugby for their support as we aim to vaccinate 2,500 patients over the next few weeks. “The Covid booster and flu vaccines have a vital role to play in protecting people this winter. We would very much encourage patients who are eligible for both jabs to come forward when their turn comes. You don’t have to contact your GP – they will contact you.” Meanwhile, 10 further deaths of patients who had previously tested positive for Covid-19 have been reported in Northern Ireland. The region’s Department of Health has also reported another 1,323 cases of the virus.\n",

      "Apple and other major tech firms have pushed back their return-to-office indefinitely. (Photo: Getty) Amid the surge in Omicron cases in the US, Apple is making booster vaccines mandatory for all its employees. Apple employees must submit proof of Covid-19 boosters or be required to take tests to enter stores and offices from February 15. ‘Due to waning efficacy of the primary series of Covid-19 vaccines and the emergence of highly transmissible variants such as Omicron, a booster shot is now part of staying up to date with your Covid-19 vaccination to protect against severe disease,’ according to an internal memo seen by tech site The Verge. Apple will require unvaccinated employees — or those who haven’t yet submitted proof of vaccination — to provide negative Covid rapid antigen tests before entering the workplace beginning on January 24th. Employees who are eligible for booster shots have four weeks to get jabbed. It wasn’t immediately clear if this testing requirement applies to both corporate and retail employees. The move comes as American employers’ plans to return to the office were thwarted by the surging cases of the Omicron variant. Want to work for Apple? You’ll need to have had your Covid jab (Getty) Apple and other major tech firms have pushed back their return-to-office indefinitely. Last week, Facebook’s parent company Meta made it compulsory for its employees to have booster shots when its US campuses reopen in March. Meanwhile, Amazon has offered US warehouse workers $40 if they get a booster, reported The Information last Thursday. While Google hasn’t mandated company-wide booster shots yet, it requires employees to have had the first two doses of the Covid-19 vaccine and get tested weekly. Last year, Apple asked that unvaccinated corporate employees take daily tests before entering the office, while unvaccinated retail workers were asked to test twice a week. The company also began requiring vaccinated individuals to take COVID-19 tests once every week, and later lowered the frequency of these tests. The US reported over 337k new cases of Covid-19 yesterday. Metro.co.uk has reached out to Apple for comment.

      "The human suffering in Ukraine is immense and leaves all of us aghast. Prosaic as it may sound by comparison, however, the economic effect of the Russia/Ukraine conflict is also trickling down into Belgium and the rest of the world, as prices for utilities and food are on the rise almost everywhere. Soon enough, Belgian employers will feel the impact of the increased cost of living in their own employment costs, as unusually almost all Belgian wage rates are in some form mechanically linked to the cost of living. Indexation of wages is determined at industry-level and the methods differ depending on the sector: in the Chemicals sector for example, wages are increased not at a fixed time, but each time the consumer price index increases by 2%, which will next be the case later this month, for example. Joint Committee nr. 200 – one of the committees representing the most employees in Belgium (more than 480,000 in total) – has a different mechanism: salaries are only increased with effect from January each year to reflect the evolution of the adjusted health index over the previous year (health index being the consumer price index, minus certain unhealthy products, such as alcoholic beverages). Payroll agency SD Worx forecasts that the employees in JC 200 can count on an 8.38% pay increase in January ’23, and that on top of the already quite steep 3.58% increase at the start of this year. Might this whopping increase still be avoided? Not very likely. In theory, the social partners in the different Joint Committees may still change the rules to soften the impact of the automatic indexation, but it is not very plausible that the unions will agree to such a measure. Similarly, the government could also impose a so-called “index jump” which temporarily overrules the sectoral indexation mechanisms, as it has done most recently in 2015, in an endeavour to prevent an unstoppable upward spiral of costs feeding off itself. Employers’ organisations have already requested a repeat, at least for the higher-end wages, but so far politicians’ reaction has been lukewarm at best. So if these pay rises cannot be prevented, what is the message of this blog? It is that while these increases may be inevitable, the impact that they will have on your costs of employment may still be mitigated to some extent. First off, in the near future, when you consider rewarding or attracting talent, it is advised to focus on solutions which will not be affected by the automatic index increase. The indexation applies to the employees’ regular monthly salary, including any increases in salary you award in the course of this year. Regular bonuses and one-off discretionary payments in the course of this year, such as sign-on bonuses and incentive awards, will not be caught by it, but may nonetheless go a long way to keep your employees happy. Also do consider again (if your unions will permit it) the size of the automatic pay ratchets in your company’s merit increase process, to avoid having to pay more than the company’s margins allow. Second, in choosing compensation methods, this year is also the time to consider the options that give the “best bang for your buck” in terms of attracting talent and staff retention. Employees see the rise in their supermarket and electricity bills and those who are not feeling it yet are still worried because they read about it in the newspapers every day. They will be looking in most cases for the highest net possible. However, while regular salary increases and bonuses are nice, of course they are, there are other potentially more interesting options available in terms of employer cost vs. net result ratio: Are your employees still wholly or partly working from home after the pandemic? If so, are they already receiving a cost allowance to compensate for the cost of electricity, water and cookies they consume while working from their kitchen table? More details on the cost allowance can be found in our Working from Home series. Instead of awarding a regular bonus, you may consider introducing a collective results-based bonus as per Collective Labour Agreement nr. 90. The bonus is subject to social security contributions, but up to an amount of €3.094 per head per year it is tax exempt. This bonus may also in part replace the company bonus plan for the achievement of company or group targets. Individual targets may not be compensated through the collective results-based bonus so this is not the way forward for bonuses which are based purely on individual achievement. Do your staff members have young children? For those so blessed/burdened, a company allowance on top of the state child allowance may be very welcome. Please do contact us first to discuss, as the Social Security Service is very strict in the conditions it imposes for the allowance to be exempt from social security contribution. These allowances would also fall outside the indexation mechanism. There are still quite some other benefits to consider which are easier to digest in terms of social security contributions and employment tax and which fall outside the indexation mechanism: meal vouchers, eco vouchers, and why not, the discounted purchase of an e-bike? These benefits have an immediate impact on the employee’s net spending power and the added cost for the employer is significantly lower than the equivalent in regular salary or a bonus. If employees are more comfortable about their immediate financial situation, a group insurance pension plan also remains an attractive way to compensate employees and provide the reassurance that they may see out their days somewhere warm on the Costa Del Something. The next few months may prove to be tumultuous for employers everywhere, but the measures above may prove useful also for the years to come. If any political measures are taken to soften the impact of automatic indexation in Belgium, we will of course also inform you through this blog.\n",

      "From the United States to Israel, from Australia to Ireland - most agree that a rapid rollout of the Covid-19 vaccination is the key to reopening the economy. But already, employers, unions and lawyers are grappling with thorny issues around vaccination - including what happens when an employee does not want to get vaccinated. Publican Noel Anderson, who chairs the Licensed Vintners Association, is desperate to reopen his two bars: Lemon and Duke in Dublin city centre, and the Bridge in Ballsbridge. \"Our industry is decimated,\" he says. \"I have colleagues who have been closed for nearly 13 months. We ourselves have been closed three times and I've had to lay off 70 staff three times. There is nothing more difficult. But with vaccination rollout central to government decisions to reopen, businesses are beginning to ask what they should do about staff who refuse to be vaccinated without good cause. \"We've had LVA members contacting us to say what would be the implications of opening with vaccinated staff and only letting in vaccinated customers. That's not for the LVA to give guidance on, that's up to the Government - but that conversation is happening,\" he confirms. A survey last January by human resources technology firm HR Locker of 750 employers in the UK and Ireland revealed that 40% of respondents would be prepared to dismiss an employee who refused to get vaccinated without a reasonable excuse. 23% of organisations polled planned to mandate vaccination for their staff. However, a mandatory vaccination policy would bring huge employment law, human rights and constitutional issues into play - and critics warn it could give rise to employee claims for discrimination, unfair dismissal or adverse health reactions to the injection. The Irish Council for Civil Liberties argues that it would be \"very questionable\" on legal grounds if employers tried to take unilateral action to force employees to take a medicine. \"We have in this country a public health strategy based on principles of consent, trust and solidarity - and any actions by employers trying to discriminate between employees threatens to undermine that and I think would be illegal,\" says ICCL Chief Executive Liam Herrick. He also fears compulsion could trigger a backlash and undermine the key aim of widespread take up of the vaccine. He argues the issue is hypothetical at present, given that so many people are simply unable to access the vaccine. \"We've written to the Government seeking a clear message that there will be no tolerance of discrimination on the basis of vaccines,\" he confirms. We need your consent to load this rte-player contentWe use rte-player to manage extra content that can set cookies on your device and collect data about your activity. Please review their details and accept them to load the content.Manage Preferences However, employment lawyer Richard Grogan argues the situation is far from hypothetical, and that jobs may be at risk for those refusing vaccination. \"The reality is that under the Health Safety and Welfare at Work Act employers have to take care of the health of staff,\" he notes, adding that issues may arise in getting unvaccinated people back into the office. He says he does not like the phrase mandatory vaccination but adds: \"If an employer cannot bring people back into the workplace, there are going to be job losses - and those who are vaccinated will be back in the office, and those who aren't will lose their jobs. \"From barbers to hairdressers to restaurants - how can they operate if people aren't vaccinated? It won't just be an issue of no jab no job - it will be no jab no entry, as we've seen in other countries.\" Mr Grogan acknowledges that no one can be forced to take a vaccine - but warns that if employees cannot return to on-site working alongside other colleagues without a reasonable excuse, such as a disability, they may be redundant, as they can no longer do their job as the employer requires. The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment confirmed that employers cannot compel employees to be vaccinated. However, it acknowledges that there may be situations where, following a risk assessment, it is deemed unsafe to allow a unvaccinated person to carry out their duties. It recommends in such instances that the employer should consider redeployment, with the consent of the employee. However, it does not address what happens if there is no alternative role available within the company. Mandatory vaccination would be fraught with legal and human rights problems - and is undoubtedly a nettle that no one wants to grasp. But as the vaccine rollout progresses, employers like Noel Anderson and his colleagues will be awaiting guidance from the Government on how to handle this potentially controversial issue.

But he says Canada’s ability to get more doses out the door to lower-income countries depends mostly on getting reassurance they can and will be used when they are sent. Canada is promising to donate at least 200 million doses by the end of the year but only 15 million have been delivered so far.

Monday Masks could be required in Edmonton recreation centres after council debate two new mask bylaws on Tuesday Lauren Boothby, Edmonton Journal Photo by Postmedia file Edmonton has done away with mask rules to coincide with the Alberta government’s approach, but on Tuesday the city is expected to vote on two new bylaws that could make masks legally required in more locations again. Advertisement 7 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content The first bylaw would require masks on public transit and in city-owned and operated facilities. The second bylaw would essentially reinstate former mask mandates but only if the city receives the province’s blessing. City administration recommends both bylaws be approved. Masks are still required on public transit in Alberta but bylaw officers can’t enforce it unless there is a city-specific rule, according to a staff report. However, staff warn requiring masks in other locations may create conflicts. “With only the current provincial requirement in place, current enforcement falls to the Edmonton Police Service, which would need to prioritize calls for service accordingly,” states the staff report.

Tam says the number of new cases of the virus have started to level off after weeks of decline. In Canada, the daily average number of people in hospital with COVID-19 declined by 11 per cent since last week, and the number of people in intensive care declined by 14 per cent. The spread of COVID-19 abroad has been partially blamed on BA.2, a sublineage of the Omicron variant that has been dubbed “stealth Omicron.” Deputy chief public health officer Dr. Howard Njoo says the spread of BA.2 seems to be highest in places where booster vaccine coverage is low and fewer people were infected with Omicron in the last wave.

The province reported 619 new cases of COVID-19 on Thursday and a test positivity rate of 22.6 per cent.

Medicago’s two-dose Covifenz vaccine was authorized by Health Canada in February for adults 18 to 64. In clinical trials it was more than 70 per cent effective at preventing COVID-19 infections and 100 per cent effective against severe illness, prior to the Omicron wave.

Thursday Omicron BA.2 subvariant becoming dominant, representing potential risk Elizabeth Payne, Ottawa Citizen GETTY IMAGES The rise of the more-contagious Omicron subvariant in Canada could represent a threat to the elderly and others who are vulnerable, warns a leading expert on BA.2. The concern comes as Ontario and other provinces are dropping pandemic restrictions and immunity from third doses of COVID-19 vaccine is waning for many of the most vulnerable. Ontario is offering fourth doses to long-term care and other vulnerable residents. Advertisement 24 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content The BA.2 subvariant, which is behind record case counts and deaths in some parts of the world, is on its way to becoming dominant in Ontario and across Canada. As of this week, about 50 per cent of new COVID-19 cases in the country are BA.2, squeezing out the original Omicron subvariant, BA.1, said Sarah Otto, a professor of evolutionary virology and mathematical modelling at the University of British Columbia. While cases of BA.1 are dropping across Canada, BA.2 cases are increasing slightly or remaining steady.

Advertisement 25 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content Deaths have skyrocketed, the health system is swamped, morgues are overflowing and public confidence in the city government is at an all-time low. While the government sticks to a “zero-COVID” policy similar to that of mainland China, city leader Carrie Lam hinted on Thursday she could ease restrictions amid concerns over the city’s status as a global financial hub. But with infections spilling over on to the mainland and local cases hovering around 30,000 per day among a population of just 7.4 million, there needs to be a clear exit strategy, in line with learning to live with the virus, like other major cities, rather than trying to eradicate it, health experts say. Densely populated Hong Kong has registered the most deaths per million people globally in recent weeks – more than 24 times that of rival Singapore – due to a large proportion of elderly who were unvaccinated as the highly transmissible Omicron variant ripped through care homes since February. Read more Thursday Italy to announce plan to scrap COVID-19 restrictions Reuters Photo by CIRO DE LUCA / REUTERS The Italian government was set to announce a two-step plan on Thursday scrapping most of its coronavirus restrictions as the country nears the end of its state of emergency. Prime Minister Mario Draghi’s government was to meet to approve a plan to soften the curbs, a cabinet statement said. Draghi and Health Minister Roberto Speranza will hold a news conference afterwards to detail the decisions. The state of emergency, which allows public authorities to bypass bureaucracy and impose rules via decrees, was first introduced at the start of the pandemic, on Jan. 31, 2020. The moves in Italy follow other European countries where most COVID curbs have been lifted. France no longer requires face masks to be worn in most public places and allows people who have not been vaccinated into bars, restaurants and cinemas. Italy saw coronavirus cases and deaths recede after a surge in daily infections at the start of the year. However think tank Gimbe, noting that cases are again rising, suggested the government should be cautious in relaxing curbs. “Measures have to be relaxed on the basis of scientific evidence, not to emulate other countries,” Gimbe said in its weekly report.

Font size: A - | A + Comments disabled The pandemic situation in Slovakia is getting worse. Our paywall policy The Slovak Spectator has decided to make all the articles on the special measures, statistics and basic information about the coronavirus available to everyone. If you appreciate our work and would like to support good journalism, please buy our subscription. We believe this is an issue where accurate and fact-based information is important for people to cope. Four districts, namely Bardejov, Krupina, Rožňava and Skalica, have switched to the dark red tier, meaning they will follow a very strict regime from Monday, September 20. Bardejov toughened up its measures last Friday (September 17), given the rapidly worsening developments.

Only four districts (Dunajská Streda, Medzilaborce, Pezinok, and Poltár) are in the green tier, meaning the restrictions are very mild. The Slovak Spectator selected certain rules the districts now need to follow based on the alert system, known as the Covid automat. At the same time, the cabinet approved changes to border controls, switching to the green tier of its border alert system. This means checks will only be conducted at random starting Monday.

      "Demand for foreign holidays is bouncing back following the relaxation of coronavirus travel rules and could reach pre-pandemic levels within months, travel firms say. A surge in bookings has come after Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced on Wednesday that the testing and quarantine requirements for arrivals will be eased. As of 4am on Friday, fully vaccinated travellers and under-18s arriving in the UK no longer need to have taken a pre-departure lateral flow test. They can instead take a lateral flow test rather than the more expensive PCR version for their post-arrival test from 4am on Sunday, with the changes saving a family of four around £300. Spain has come top as the most popular overseas destination people plan to visit this year, followed by the US, France, Italy and Greece, according to a survey of 2,000 UK consumers by travel trade organisation Abta. Advertisement But what are the COVID situations in these popular hotspots? Image: People queue to receive a free lateral flow COVID test in Madrid, Spain Spain Under the current rules, only travellers who have been fully vaccinated against COVID-19 can travel to Spain without having to follow additional entry rules, even if their origin country is part of the country's risk list. COVID infections are still rising across Spain as the country grapples with a sixth wave of the virus due to the highly transmissible Omicron strain. As of Christmas Eve, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez introduced the wearing of face masks outdoors in a bid to contain the strain - meaning tourists visiting the country may have to mask up for most of their holidays. However, face coverings are not compulsory during exercise, on the beach or at the pool so long as social distancing of 1.5 metres is maintained. Image: People line up in Times Square, New York, for a COVID-19 test US The US eased its travel restrictions at the beginning of November before the Omicron variant hit. It has since suspended entry for non-citizens who have been in Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, and Zimbabwe during the 14-day period preceding their entry or attempted entry into the country. However, most fully vaccinated foreign citizens can enter the US. Before boarding a flight to the US, most passengers will be required to show a negative COVID-19 test result taken no more than one day before travel. Currently, everyone aged two and above who is not fully vaccinated has to wear a mask in indoor public places, however, this does not apply in outdoor settings. People are expected to wear face coverings on planes, buses, trains, and other forms of public transportation travelling into, within, or out of the US, as well as indoors at transportation hubs such as airports and stations. Image: Masked-up residents and tourists walk along the Champs Elysee in Paris France Those wishing to travel from the UK to France, regardless of vaccination status, can only do so for essential reasons. As of Thursday, people can now travel between the UK and France for work-related reasons requiring an on-site presence, which cannot be postponed, with travellers required to provide proof from their employer. France had earlier relaxed its travel measures over the festive period following an outcry from British nationals unable to travel home via the Eurotunnel. Wearing masks even outdoors was made mandatory in Paris last month as the country struggles to come to grips with an Omicron surge. Image: A visitor shows his green pass at the entrance to the Roman Forum in Rome, Italy Italy Regardless of vaccination status, arriving in Italy by air, land or by sea may be subject to random COVID testing on arrival until 31 January. If you travel from the UK and can demonstrate that you are fully vaccinated with a negative PCR test, you can enter Italy without needing to self-isolate. Travellers are required to wear a mask at all times when using public transport in Italy, but this rule does not apply outdoors. Everyone is also required to keep a distance of at least one metre, with only high-speed trains not having social distancing rules. Since October, cultural venues have been allowed to operate at full capacity, including theatres, cinemas, and concert venues. Image: A shop employee checks customers' vaccination certificates in Athens, Greece Greece People travelling to Greece will need to complete a Passenger Locator Form (PLF) and proof of a negative PCR or rapid antigen COVID test. In response to the Omicron surge, the country's government last month reintroduced mandatory mask-wearing outdoors. Double-masking or wearing a high-protection face covering is also required on public transport and in supermarkets. All travellers, regardless of their vaccination status, have been advised to take a lateral flow or PCR test on the second and fourth day after their arrival in the country. Travel back to pre-COVID levels 'by spring' Steve Heapy, chief executive of Jet2holidays and leisure airline Jet2.com, revealed the firm has reported huge popularity for trips to mainland Spain, the Canaries, the Balearic Islands, Turkey, and Greece. He said: \"The relaxation of travel restrictions is welcome news for both the travel industry and holidaymakers and comes during what is traditionally a very busy period for holiday bookings.

A spokeswoman for the tour operator said Mr Johnson's announcement \"has given Brits the reassurance that travel will once again be easier and more affordable\". She continued: \"We've already seen an immediate and strong uptick in bookings and we now expect summer 2022 bookings to be normalised. \"January is traditionally the busiest month for holiday bookings and demand is yet to reach pre-COVID levels, so we need to see sustained confidence in travel so the industry can fully recover.\" Subscribe to the Daily podcast on Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts, Spotify, Spreaker Meanwhile, luxury travel company Kuoni predicts travel to reach pre-pandemic levels by spring. Its chief executive, Derek Jones, said the easing of testing rules \"should be the beginning of the end of COVID as a blocker to international travel\". He added: \"I predict travel will be 90% back to 2019 levels before the end of spring. \"We're already seeing increased call volumes and inquiries about trips for the year ahead as confidence builds.\"\n",

      "People should be paid to have a COVID-19 jab so the country reaches herd immunity as quickly as possible, a leading ethicist has suggested. Professor Julian Savulescu from the University of Oxford said incentives would help to overcome rising vaccine hesitancy due to perceived safety concerns. People could either be given a financial inducement to have the jab or they could be paid in kind, perhaps foregoing the need to wear a facemask in public, he writes in the Journal of Medical Ethics. \"The advantage of payment for risk is that people are choosing voluntarily to take it on,\" he says. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 6:21 PM: 'There is light at the end of the tunnel' \"As long as we are accurate in conveying the limitations in our confidence about the risks and benefits of a vaccine, then it is up to individuals to judge whether they are worth payment.\" Advertisement To achieve herd immunity, which would stop the coronavirus spreading and end the epidemic, somewhere between 50 and 80% of the population would have to be protected. Prof Savulescu says that there is a case for mandatory vaccination because of the \"grave\" threat to public health. Coercion for the public good is already accepted in wearing seat belts and conscription during wartime. But he says mandatory vaccination would be unethical without first knowing a jab was completely safe.

But rare side effects may remain. \"It may be those who are poorer may be more inclined to take the money and the risk, but this applies to all risky or unpleasant jobs in a market economy,\" he says. \"It is not necessarily exploitation if there are protections in place such as a minimum wage or a fair price is paid to take on risk.\" Podcast Due to your consent preferences, you’re not able to view this.

But Professor Keith Neal, an infectious disease epidemiologist at the University of Nottingham, said paying people to get vaccinated would set a \"very dangerous precedent\". \"If we did this, people will expect it for other vaccines and also social media falsehoods would have a field day suggesting it can't be safe if that's what you need to be paid to have it. He added: \"The money would be much better spent in other parts of the NHS or providing vaccine to low income countries to prevent possible re-introduction into the UK.\"\n",

      "UK nationals and residents returning from 30 \"red list\" countries will be placed in quarantine in government-provided accommodation - such as hotels - for 10 days, Boris Johnson has told MPs. The prime minister said the new measures are aimed at preventing new mutant COVID strains from reaching the UK. Mr Johnson reiterated that, under England's national lockdown, it is currently \"illegal to leave home to travel abroad for leisure purposes\". He said the government would \"enforce this at ports and airports by asking people why they are leaving and instructing them to return home if they do not have a valid reason to travel\". And, announcing the new hotel quarantine requirements, Mr Johnson told MPs the government had already banned travel from countries \"where there is a risk of known variants including South Africa, Portugal and South American nations\". Advertisement \"In order to reduce the risk posed by UK nationals and residents returning home from these countries, I can announce that we will require all such arrivals who cannot be refused entry to isolate in government provided accommodation, such as hotels, for 10 days without exception,\" he added. \"They will be met at the airport and transported directly into quarantine.\" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 4:41 A holiday is not a valid reason to travel Mr Johnson said the Department of Health and Social Care was working to establish quarantine facilities \"as quickly as possible\". The 30 countries on the \"red list\" include all those in South America, as well as large parts of Southern Africa and Portugal. Home Secretary Priti Patel, setting out the new measures to the House of Commons, later told MPs \"there are still too many people coming in and out of our country each day\". She said the further action was aimed at reducing \"passenger flow so that only a small number of people for whom it is absolutely essential to travel are doing so and therefore reducing the risk to our world-leading vaccine programme\". Ms Patel also reinforced the message that \"going on holiday is not a valid reason\" to ignore the current stay at home order. \"We will introduce a new requirement so that people wishing to travel must first make a declaration as to why they need to travel,\" she told MPs. \"This reason for travel will be checked by carriers prior to departure and this approach effectively mirrors the checks on arrivals that are already in place with the passenger locator form.\" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 1:59 'Why has the UK the highest number of deaths?' It is understood travellers from \"red list\" countries will have to pay to isolate in a monitored hotel, with coronavirus testing carried out during their stay. The move has been widely anticipated in recent weeks, with critics arguing the government should have taken tougher action sooner. They have pointed to the examples of Australia and New Zealand, who have had mandatory quarantines since the early weeks of the pandemic and have largely eliminated transmission of the virus within their borders. Reports in recent days have emerged of competing views in government over how wide ranging the mandatory quarantine should be. It has been suggested that some ministers have been arguing the mandatory quarantine should apply to arrivals for all countries, while others have been advocating targeting certain nations deemed to pose more of a risk. Labour's shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds said the hotel quarantine plans were \"too limited\". \"Mutations of the virus risk undermining the efficacy of the vaccines, threatening life and hope,\" he told MPs. \"We cannot know where these mutations will emerge from next and the truth is the government is once again behind the curve. \"Labour is calling for a comprehensive hotel quarantining. Today's announcement is too limited, it leaves huge gaps in our defences against emerging strains. \"We know that the strains that emerged in South Africa and Brazil have already reached these shores. Little wonder really when controls have been so lax.\" Podcast Due to your consent preferences, you’re not able to view this. Open Privacy Options Subscribe to the Daily podcast on Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts, Spotify, Spreaker The SNP's Westminster leader Ian Blackford earlier told Mr Johnson that \"both the Scottish and Welsh governments want to go further on quarantine measures than what his UK government is proposing\". He called on the prime minister to \"stop his half measures\" and introduce \"stricter enforcement on international travel\". A Welsh government spokesperson said: \"We have agreed on the need for a joint approach between the four nations of the UK and the Republic of Ireland to strengthen border health measures, in order to prevent the further spread of coronavirus. \"However, we do not believe the approach as set out by the UK government goes far enough. Further discussions on the details of the proposals will take place as soon as possible.\" The full list of \"red list\" countries are: Angola, Argentina, Bolivia, Botswana, Brazil, Cape Verde, Chile, Colombia, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ecuador, Eswatini, French Guiana, Guyana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Portugal, Seychelles, South Africa, Suriname, Tanzania, Uruguay, Venezuela, Zambia and Zimbabwe.\n",

The COVID-19 situation has much improved since early January when students had to start the year learning from home due to soaring hospitalization rates fueled by the highly contagious Omicron variant. What a difference a couple of months make. On Friday, Quebec hospitalizations fell below 1,600 – the lowest point since Jan. 3. At the peak of the Omicron wave, in mid-January, the province had more than 3,400 COVID-positive patients. Advertisement 4 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content Many of the Omicron-inspired restrictions announced in December are now falling by the wayside. When they return to classrooms on March 7, elementary and high school students will no longer have to wear masks at their desks, though they’ll still be mandatory in hallways, common areas and on school buses. Some experts have criticized the move, suggesting it may be coming too early, in part because of fears many children will become infected during the break and spread the disease when they head back to school. But Quebec public health officials say the benefits of dropping masks in classrooms outweigh the risks. Masks in many other settings are still required in Quebec for now. But the public health department is working on a timeline to gradually lift mask restrictions. Advertisement 5 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content On Friday, Dr. Theresa Tam, Canada’s chief public health officer, said authorities should be ready to re-impose some health measures in the fall, when respiratory viruses tend to resurge. She said she would favour “less heavy” measures such as mask mandates. In the United States, changes announced Friday in how the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention assesses outbreaks could result in a reduction in the number of places where Americans are advised to wear masks. As part of Quebec’s gradual reopening plan, more restrictions are set to be lifted next week. Among other things, as of Monday, Feb. 28: Employers can start welcoming workers back at workplaces. All capacity limits will be lifted at places of worship and funerals. Bars can reopen, at half capacity. Bars and restaurants can stay open until 1 a.m, with alcohol and food sales ending at midnight. Under current rules, establishments must close at midnight, with alcohol and food sales ending at 11 p.m. Venues and places of worship will be able to open at 100-per-cent capacity; the exceptions: Montreal’s Bell Centre and the Centre Vidéotron in Quebec City.

The vaccine passport will no longer be required, apart from international travel. “After March 14, almost all restrictions will be lifted,” Premier François Legault said when he announced the timeline on Feb. 8. “We’re taking a calculated risk to learn how to live with the virus, and the best way to live with the virus is to get your three doses of vaccine.” 3 p.m. Ottawa anti-government convoy organizer Pat King denied bail From The Canadian Press: A prominent organizer of the three-week convoy protest near Parliament Hill has been denied bail. Pat King was arrested last Friday and faces charges of mischief, counselling to commit mischief, counselling to commit the offence of disobeying a court order and counselling to obstruct police.

As Seymour delivered the ruling this afternoon, King sat in-person in the courtroom at the Ottawa courthouse, wearing a camouflage jacket over a grey hoodie and matching sweat pants. He shifted between hunching forward and leaning up against the wall behind him. 2:10 p.m. Public health measures could return, Tam warns, but she favours ‘less heavy’ measures like mask mandates From The Canadian Press: Canada’s chief public health officer says governments should be prepared to bring back public health measures in case of another serious variant of COVID-19. Advertisement 8 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content Several provinces have begun to scale back on mandates for vaccines and masks, signalling a return to normalcy now that the Omicron wave is waning. Dr. Theresa Tam says she hopes Canada is past the pandemic crisis and is now in a transition phase, headed toward recovery.

But a new report from the federal intelligence service suggests that extremist groups could be using that worldview to recruit and attempt to destabilize government.

Article content Prosecutors are asking an Ottawa court to reopen the bail hearing for a prominent organizer of the three-week convoy protest near Parliament Hill. Pat King was arrested last Friday and faces charges of mischief, counselling to commit mischief, counselling to commit the offence of disobeying a court order and counselling to obstruct police. Justice of the Peace Andrew Seymour was set to issue a ruling before the Crown made a rare request to reopen the hearing to submit new evidence. Crown attorney Moiz Karimjee says King violated the release conditions of a 2016 charge for uttering threats, which Karimjee argues shows King can’t be trusted to follow the terms of any release. King’s lawyer, Cal Rosemond, is asking Seymour to dismiss Karimjee’s request, saying that Karimjee could have unearthed this before King’s bail hearing earlier this week.

The changes, which are due to be announced Friday, would shift how the agency assesses risk from the virus. With more than 64 per cent of Americans fully vaccinated and many having already been infected, it would emphasize the burden on hospitals and the rate of severe cases, as opposed to overall case levels. Advertisement 12 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content The new formula combines cases, hospitalizations and hospital capacity as a measure of severity, one of the people said. Cases are still considered but in the context of other factors. The result would likely be fewer places where Americans are advised to take precautions such as mask-wearing. Currently, the CDC recommends that in areas of “high” or “substantial” transmission that “everyone should wear a mask in public, indoor settings.” Currently, the CDC considers counties that have recorded more than 100 COVID-19 cases per 100,000 people in the past week, or that have a test positivity rate of 10 per cent or above, to have “high” transmission. According to the agency, 82 per cent of the country fits that definition, even though new daily cases have plunged to their lowest level since before the most recent wave began.

The requirement, enacted in October, is to end Tuesday, because the province’s COVID-19 numbers, including the number of people in hospital, have continued to improve after spiking in mid-January. “We’ve seen the large Omicron wave. We have a significant proportion of the population protected now through vaccine,” Dr. Brent Roussin, chief public health officer, said Thursday. “None of these public health restrictions were in place permanently.” Advertisement 15 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content The vaccine or test requirement included any public-sector workers — including doctors, nurses, child-care workers and jail guards — in contact with people more vulnerable to infection. Almost 200 workers in health care were put on unpaid leave last fall for not complying. An end to the public health measure was a surprise to Doctors Manitoba, which represents some 4,000 physicians, retired doctors and medical students. “While the Omicron wave is receding, we are at a critical transitional stage in this pandemic, and our health facilities are not yet back to normal,” the group said in a prepared statement. The Opposition New Democrats said the Progressive Conservative government is moving too fast. “It’s the wrong decision and shows the lack of this government’s willingness to prioritize the folks in our communities who are most vulnerable to COVID-19,” health critic Uzoma Asagwara said.

Article content Provincial data Thursday showed 524 people in hospital with COVID-19, 32 of them in intensive care. The total number of intensive care patients, including non-COVID-19 cases, was at 106 — well above the pre-pandemic normal capacity of 72. To free up beds and deal with the surge in hospitals since the pandemic began, thousands of surgeries and diagnostic tests have been delayed, patients have been moved between communities and hundreds of health-care workers have been shifted from their normal duties. Ending the vaccine requirement for workers on March 1 will coincide with members of the public no longer having to show proof of vaccination to attend restaurants, concert halls, theatres and other venues. Some venues are saying they plan to keep the rule in place anyway. Advertisement 17 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.

The Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra, after consulting its supporters, also said it is keeping mask and vaccination rules in place until at least the end of March. “About 758 symphony patrons responded to the survey. Eighty-six per cent favoured keeping the vaccine mandate. Eighty-one per cent favoured keeping the mask mandate.

Article content British Columbia’s public safety minister says a significant number of people who received tickets for allegedly violating COVID-19 measures are disputing them but those who want to drive their vehicle may have to pay up. Mike Farnworth says the Insurance Corporation of B.C. will send unpaid fines to a collection agency after 30 days when the period to dispute them has ended. Other unpaid violation ticket files typically go to collections after a year. Amendments to the Motor Vehicle Act last spring allow the corporation to refuse to issue driver’s licences and vehicle licences to people who have not paid fines. A spokesman for the corporation says 2,724 tickets have been issued, amounting to over $1.9 million in fines.

Article content Brent Shearer says less than $388,000 of that amount has been paid so far for 736 tickets; guilty verdicts were the result of court action related to 1,181 tickets. He says court dates have been requested to dispute 417 tickets and that a further 390 tickets fall into various categories like being cancelled, in dispute or having been withdrawn. The province has said people with violation tickets could request a court lower the fine if they don’t have the money to pay them. It says repayment arrangements can also be requested and will be considered by ICBC depending on financial needs. Farnworth says the province intends to collect the money that is owed. “At the end of the day, when you go to renew your ICBC insurance, you have to pay your fine. So those tickets will be paid.

      "A six-week consultation has begun on plans to make COVID-19 and flu vaccinations mandatory for frontline health and care staff, the government has announced. Ministers will hear from experts on whether workers in the sector should be fully vaccinated in order to have contact with patients and people receiving care. Only those with valid medical reasons would be exempt. Care Minister Helen Whately told Kay Burley on Thursday that the move is \"the right thing to do\" but she understands it is \"a difficult question\". Image: Care Minister Helen Whately said mandatory vaccination for care staff is 'the right thing to do' \"The situation here is, you will know - your viewers will know, that care homes have had such a tough time in this pandemic and that we have very sadly seen many residents in care homes die from COVID because they are the most vulnerable,\" she said on Sky News. \"It has to be the right thing to do to give them the best possible protection.\" Advertisement Ms Whately added: \"The reality is that one of the best ways we can protect people living in care homes is through making sure that staff are vaccinated - yes, the ongoing testing, and staff are tested weekly, is important as well - but vaccinations are a really important part of protecting those who live in care homes.\" Asked whether she acknowledges that compulsory vaccination to work in the sector will lead to staff shortages, the care minister added: \"I know that the sector faces huge numbers of vacancies and that there is a large amount of turnover.\" Ms Whately continued: \"Actually, already 90% of workers in care homes have been vaccinated. There is still time to get vaccinated. \"The big question has to be well if you don't want to get vaccinated, how can you continue, how can it be right to continue to look after people who are really vulnerable for COVID?\" Image: New data suggests vaccine uptake rates between NHS trusts can vary from around 78% to 94% for both doses According to the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC), around 92% of NHS trust staff have received one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, with 88% of staff having received both doses. But new data suggests uptake rates between NHS trusts can vary from around 78% to 94% for both doses. The government previously said all staff in registered care homes in England must be vaccinated against COVID-19 from 11 November, unless medically exempt. The Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) has already suggested the overlap between the sectors makes a strong scientific case for similar approaches to vaccination. The DHSC said the consultation will examine the scope of the plan and any potential impact mandating vaccines could have on staffing and safety such as reducing staff sickness absence. Speaking to Sky News on Thursday, shadow communities secretary Steve Reed said making vaccinations mandatory for care home staff will \"drive away the workers\" and leave the elderly and vulnerable without care. Last week Matthew Taylor, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, which represents the frontline healthcare system in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, told Sky News mandatory vaccination was not an issue that needed tackling. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 0:50 Booster jab programme expected this month. Speaking to the Trevor Phillips On Sunday programme, Mr Taylor argued requiring all NHS staff to be jabbed as a condition of employment \"is not necessary\". He said: \"The overwhelming majority of NHS staff are choosing to be vaccinated and the important thing is to support or give people the opportunity to be vaccinated, so I think we would want to say that there is no necessity for compulsion, for surveillance of people at this stage, because the staff themselves are doing the right thing.\" Follow the Daily podcast on Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts, Spotify, Spreaker The consultation will also evaluate whether flu vaccines should be a mandated requirement and who could be included in the policy. National flu vaccination rates in the health service have increased from 14% in 2002 to 76% last year. But in some settings, rates are as low as 53%. Staff, healthcare providers, stakeholders, patients and their families are being urged to take part in the consultation, with a final decision expected this winter. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 2:19 Flu jab supplier warning of delays Health Secretary Sajid Javid urged all staff to be vaccinated, regardless of the outcome of the consultation. He said: \"Many patients being treated in hospitals and other clinical settings are most at risk of suffering serious consequences of COVID-19, and we must do what we can to protect them. \"It's so clear to see the impact vaccines have against respiratory viruses which can be fatal to the vulnerable, and that's why we're exploring mandatory vaccines for both COVID-19 and flu. \"We will consider the responses to the consultation carefully but, whatever happens, I urge the small minority of NHS staff who have not yet been jabbed to consider getting vaccinated - for their own health as well as those around them.\" The care industry has previously expressed concern over the effect mandatory vaccination may have on the sector's already-stretched staffing levels. UNISON is calling on ministers to stop \"sleepwalking into a disaster\" and end the 'no jab, no job' rule, claiming it is the only way to avert a staffing crisis. Last month, the Institute of Health and Social Care Management surveyed more than 1,000 care managers in partnership with the PA news agency. The survey found that nine in 10 managers said their workplace was experiencing staff shortages or having difficulty recruiting. A third of managers (32.8%) said they had staff quit or hand in their notice over the requirement to be vaccinated, while more than half (55.2%) said they feared they would have to dismiss staff over the coming months because they had not been vaccinated. The government's own predictions are that up to 40,000 of the more than half a million care workers in the country won't be fully vaccinated by the 11 November deadline.\n",

Dube defended the law as necessary, saying most of the remaining measures are aimed at allowing for a quick response — such as calling in temporary workers and vaccinators — in the event of a new wave of COVID-19.

One possible reason for the higher number of excess deaths could be that intense attention on COVID-19 worsened B.C.’s ability to cope with other emergencies, including the heat dome during the summer of 2021 and the continuing crisis of a tainted suppy of street drugs, according to Kimberlyn McGrail, a University of B.C. professor who published an analysis paper on Monday in the Canadian Medical Association Journal.

      "The Prince of Wales said he has been \"saddened\" by \"the variable uptake of coronavirus jabs\" in black and Asian communities. Speaking remotely at a British Asian Trust webinar on vaccine safety, Prince Charles said production of the jab was thanks to a \"superhuman effort by medical experts\", but called it a \"tragedy\" that the \"benefits of such an achievement would not be experienced by everyone\". Calling the pandemic a \"pernicious threat\" and the low vaccine rates among some communities a \"vexing issue\", he said he had been inspired to speak out to \"enable people from every background to take up the vaccine\" and \"that barriers to its adoption be removed\". Live coronavirus updates from the UK and around the world Image: A nurse at Bradford Central Mosque - a community COVID-19 vaccination centre The event also introduced a celebrity-packed video urging people to have the COVID-19 jab. Advertisement The coronavirus myth-busting short film will also be shown across the UK's main commercial TV channels - Sky, ITV, Channel 4, Channel 5 and STV - at 21:56 GMT tonight, in the \"biggest roadblock in TV history\". The three-and-a-half-minute programme, which was originally shown online, now has a host of new stars urging people to #TakeTheVaccine. Sanjeev Bhaskar, Meera Syal and Romesh Ranganathan all take part, along with singer Beverley Knight, Olympic heptathlete Denise Lewis, historian David Olusoga and actor Hugh Quarshie. It also features Mayor of London Sadiq Khan, former Coronation Street actress Shobna Gulati, cricketer Moeen Ali, and TV presenter and author Konnie Huq. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 4:57 Romesh Ranganathan, Adil Ray and Meera Syal are among the stars featured in the video Citizen Khan creator Adil Ray originally co-ordinated the video in response to research showing the pandemic disproportionately affected people from ethnic minority communities while at the same time suggesting that those people are less likely to get vaccinated. The video tackles the phenomenon of fake news surrounding vaccine take-up, which has been particularly prohibitive in South Asian communities. Twitter Due to your consent preferences, you’re not able to view this. Open Privacy Options Comedian Ranganathan jokes: \"There's no chip or tracker in the vaccine to keep watching where you go. Your mobile phone actually does a much better job of that.\" The celebrities' video also states there is no scientific evidence to suggest it will work differently on people from ethnic minorities and that it does not include pork or \"any material of fetal or animal origin\". Vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi has said he is concerned the take-up of the jab might be lower in BAME communities after a document released by the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE) found hesitancy was highest in black or black British groups, with 72% stating they were unlikely/very unlikely to get the jab, followed by Pakistani/Bangladeshi groups. Adults in minority ethnic groups are less likely to receive vaccines than those in white groups by between 10-20%, the report said. Subscribe to the Backstage podcast on Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts, Spotify, Spreaker Concluding his virtual speech, Prince Charles also thanked NHS staff who had come out of retirement to help fight COVID-19, and urged everyone to get the jab, saying: \"Vaccination will save lives… and allow us to start to hope that some things will soon return to normal for every member of our society.\" More than 15.5 million people across the UK have now received their first dose of the vaccine.

      "In short: Partygate is still a thing, energy bills might be a bit less expensive now, watch out for monkeypox (Pictures: Wales News Service/Getty) Look, you’re tired of reading about partygate, we’re tired of writing about partygate. Maybe that’s how some politicians would like us all to be – fatigued with the news, bored of reading about politics. Well, here at Metro.co.uk, we’re bloody determined not to give them the satisfaction. This week has been a particularly grim one, the latest in a particularly grim news era. We don’t blame you for ignoring constant ‘the world is ending’ notifications on your phone. So we’ve put together one handy ‘the world is ending’ report so you can rip the plaster off, get the most important bits in and go back to ignoring us. Spoiler alert: The world is not ending but this week will make you wish it would. Sue Gray report Top civil servant Sue Gray was given the very simple job of independently investigating her own bosses. She had to pause her inquiry when the Met made a U-turn and suddenly decided that allegations of law-breaking are in fact something the police tend to look into. The Met finished up, exposing Downing Street as the most Covid-law breaking area in the country, and Ms Gray was finally able to release her report on Wednesday. She concluded ‘senior leaders’ should ‘bear responsibility’ for the rule-breaking culture in government. This government Covid campaign aged well (Picture: NHS) Previously unseen photos showed the prime minister and chancellor Rishi Sunak gathered with other staff on Mr Johnson’s birthday, which both politicians got fined for. Uncovered emails revealed how one top official boasted that staff had ‘got away with drinks’, while another advisor warned staff not to wave bottles of wine around while cameras attending the daily Covid briefing were leaving. It also emerged that security and cleaners faced a ‘lack of respect and poor treatment’. A union representing those workers in government has since called for a protest. Mr Johnson told parliament he was ‘humbled and has learnt a lesson’, insisting he has taken ‘full responsibility for everything that took place on his watch’. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video Several Tory MPs have called for the prime minister to resign, with Paul Holmes quitting as parliamentary private secretary over the partygate scandal. He said: ‘It is clear to me that a deep mistrust in both the government and the Conservative Party has been created by these events, something that pains me personally as someone who always tries to represent Eastleigh and its people with integrity.’ TL;DR: *In Keir Starmer’s voice* One rule for us and another rule for them. Texas school shooting There are no words to adequately describe what happened in Texas this week. 18-year-old gunman Salvador Ramos walked into Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas, and shot 19 children and two teachers with an AR-15-style rifle. The pupils were aged between seven and 10. Irma Garcia and Eva Mireles died shielding them. Ramos was eventually shot by a border control agent. Salvador Ramos killed 19 children, two adults and injured others (Picture: Enterprise News and Pictures) This is the second-most deadly school shooting in US history (Picture: Reuters) Sorry, this video isn't available any more. It has since emerged that police stood outside the school for ‘up to an hour’ while Ramos was inside killing children. Heartbreaking footage shows parents begging officers to do something and trying to run into the school themselves. Like every other school shooting, this tragedy has ignited a debate about gun control. There have been 2,052 school shootings in the US, leaving 661 dead, since 1970 when records began. This means we have had this debate more than 2,000 times before. Of course, it sure helps that some of the big players in the debate receive millions of dollars from the National Rifle Association. You can see their names below. Blood money: Senators who have taken the most money from the NRA, according to the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence. Mitt Romney (Utah) $13,647,676 Richard Burr (North Carolina) $6,987,380 Roy Blunt (Missouri) $4,555,722 Thom Tillis (North Carolina) $4,421,333 Marco Rubio (Florida) $3,303,355 Joni Ernst (Iowa) $3,124,773 Rob Portman (Ohio) $3,063,327 Todd C.

TL;DR: 2,052 ‘thoughts and prayers’. Maybe they’ll start working at 3,000? Cost of living crisis Mr Sunak – who definitely, absolutely, categorically did not time his announcement to distract from the Sue Gray report – is splashing the cash again. The chancellor revealed the government would be giving a £400 grant to every household in the country to help with the soaring prices of electricity and gas. Initially, the chancellor offered a £200 loan in disguise for energy bills, which would have been recouped through higher bills over five years. Now every British home will automatically receive a £400 discount on their bills from October and you no longer need to repay it. There is also extra help for the most vulnerable, including a £650 one-off payment for those on benefits, a £300 grant for pensioners and an extra £150 for disabled people. You can find out if you’re eligible for any of that here. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video Mr Sunak also announced a windfall tax on oil and gas giants, which have been making extraordinary profits as consumers pay for record-high fuel prices. The chancellor, who was previously against Labour’s calls for the levy, managed to announce the windfall tax without actually saying windfall tax. Mr Sunak denied there was any political strategy behind the timing of his announcement, telling money-saving expert Martin Lewis: ‘I can categorically assure you that had no bearing on the timing for us announcing the support, I can give my absolute assurance on that and my word.’ TL;DR: Who Gray? Here’s a cheque! Monkeypox Health officials have confirmed that more than 100 cases of monkeypox have been identified in the UK. We don’t know about you but we really, really just can’t be arsed with another pandemic. The good news is, this is very different to Covid-19. The smallpox-like disease can be serious for some but it isn’t airborne and it doesn’t spread all that easily. Most people recover from moneypox within two to four weeks (Picture: Metro Graphics) The NHS says monkeypox can be spread through: Touching clothing, bedding, or towels used by someone with the monkeypox rash Touching monkeypox skin blisters or scabs Coughs or sneezes. Most people recover from their symptoms in two to four weeks but they have to be isolated to break the chain of infection. The UK has bought 20,000 doses of the smallpox vaccine to be offered to close contacts of those who get infected. TL;DR: Don’t panic. And finally…a Zoom faux pas This week, councillor Dorian Phillips lived the Zoom nightmare we’ve all feared for two years. The Plaid Cymru representative for Carmarthenshire County Council suddenly blurted out ‘f***ing swallow that, you f***ers’ on a video meeting. He has since insisted it was not aimed at fellow councillors. Dorian Phillips is the Plaid Cymru representative for Carmarthenshire County Council (Picture: Wales News Service) He said: ‘I cannot deny that I used profane language, but it was not directed at anyone at that meeting. ‘During the session, I had to deal with a non-council business conversation which became very heated, in which colourful language was used. ‘I was horrified to learn that my microphone was turned on and the impression given that I was addressing the meeting. This was certainly not the case. ‘I deeply regret that this happened and I’m dismayed it should be seen as being directed at fellow councillors.’ Mr Phillips referred himself to the public service ombudsman, but Labour councillors have called on him to be suspended from Plaid Cymru by party leader Adam Price.

Article content Thursday ‘A nation forever changed’: Biden honours 1 million Americans dead from COVID Reuters Photo by Drew Angerer / Getty Images President Joe Biden on Thursday commemorated the death of 1 million people in the Unites States from COVID-19, marking what he called “a tragic milestone” and urging Americans to “remain vigilant” amid the ongoing pandemic. In a statement, Biden acknowledged the loss’ impact on families left behind and urged the country not to “grow numb to such sorrow,” noting “a nation forever changed.”The United States on Wednesday recorded more than 1 million COVID-19 deaths, according to a Reuters tally, crossing a once-unthinkable milestone about two years after the first cases upended everyday life. The loss represents about one death for every 327 Americans, or more than the entire population of San Francisco or Seattle. Biden will mark the grim milestone by ordering flags to be flown at half-staff, said the White House, which will on Thursday also host a second global COVID Summit.

Or it’s been lying Bloomberg News Photo by KCNA via REUTERS Few health experts believe North Korea managed to keep out COVID-19 since early 2020. So when Kim Jong Un officially confirmed the nation’s first case on Thursday, the question was “Why now?” Advertisement 7 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content Kim has long trumpeted his virus-control measures as evidence of his nation’s superiority, calling the efforts as a “shining success.” He sealed the border, crippling an already anemic economy and banned athletes from two Olympics. To keep the disease out, his troops even shot, killed and burned the body of a South Korean government employee who drifted near a nautical border. All along, outsiders speculated that COVID was already in North Korea, despite its isolation. The commander of U.S. Forces Korea said as early as July 2020 the virus had almost certainly made its way into the country, and both China and Russia had reported outbreaks near their borders with North Korea. Now, after 520 million cases have been reported around the world, North Korea has acknowledged that the virus indeed has arrived — leaving Turkmenistan as the only nation still claiming to have zero cases. Kim, wearing a mask, ordered all cities to lock down Thursday after a hastily called Politburo meeting.

The U.S. will contribute an additional $200 million to a global health fund for future pandemic preparedness at the World Bank, he said, bringing its total contribution to $450 million. “We are making available health technologies that are owned by the United States government, including stabilized spike protein that is used in many COVID-19 vaccines,” Biden said in his opening speech for the second global COVID-19 summit.

Read more Thursday Manulife results hit by COVID resurgence in Asia, but CEO sees tailwind from rising rates Barbara Shecter Photo by Peter J. Thompson/National Post While fast-rising interest rates are hurting borrowers, insurance companies are poised to reap the benefit of a trend that makes it easier to match investments to long-term liabilities and spurs the popularity of some financial products such as annuities. Advertisement 10 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content “Interest rates generally are positive for the insurance industry and they’re certainly a positive for Manulife, and they manifest themselves in a variety of ways,” Roy Gori, chief executive of Toronto-based Manulife Financial Corp., said in an interview Wednesday. “Higher rates make our products more attractive (and) they also drive higher margins. When you think about long liabilities, when you are able to reinvest your assets at higher rates, where you do have a significant fixed-income portfolio, that translates into improved profitability.” The impact won’t be seen overnight, Gori said, but rather in the long-term value of the business. He said the inflation that is causing central banks around the world to raise rates at a fairly rapid pace tends to drive up costs, but he expects that to be offset by past efforts to digitize Manulife’s insurance and wealth management processes. For example, 90 per cent of claims are now paid digitally, and auto-underwriting is being used for more than 70 per cent of new business.

Daily cases in Beijing have remained in the dozens, a tiny fraction of the outbreak in Shanghai and what other cities around the world now shrug off as they look to “live with the virus.” But with gradually tightening curbs in China’s capital – most recently suspending taxi services in some virus-hit districts – rumors swirled on Thursday that it was headed for lockdown, something Beijing has avoided during the entire pandemic.

Alberta’s Health Minister Jason Copping said Wednesday that there’s evidence that viral transmission is slowing, including a downward trend in the amount of virus in wastewater for most of Alberta. But hospital occupancy is high in Edmonton and Calgary, and Copping said there are complexities behind the surge. COVID, the opioid crisis and chronic medical issues that may have worsened over the past two years are all driving up the need for hospital care. “The big answer to address this is building more capacity within our system, and that takes time,” Copping said, adding that he’ll be announcing “progress” on that work in the coming days. As of May 9, there are 1,225 people hospitalized with COVID — 42 fewer than the previous week. Of the Albertans in hospital, 37 in ICU.

The same survey, which polled 585 Canadian workers aged 18 and older, reported nearly one-third (32 per cent) of respondents would change jobs if their employer required them to work exclusively from the office — and 15 per cent have already switched jobs for that reason. According to Statistics Canada, four per cent of workers were working mostly-remotely in 2016, but by 2021, largely due to the COVID-19 pandemic, that number increased to 32 per cent. Even when the pandemic is over, though, it appears workers are not eager to be back in the office full-time.

Lucki testified virtually at a House of Commons committee made up of members of Parliament and senators tasked with studying how the Emergencies Act powers were used. “In RCMP jurisdiction, we successfully used a measured approach and existing legislation to resolve border blockades,” Lucki told the committee. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced the government planned to invoke the Emergencies Act on Feb. 14 in response to blockades at border crossings and in Ottawa. Hundreds of demonstrators blocked streets in the city with big rigs and other trucks to protest COVID-19 restrictions, vaccine mandates and Trudeau’s government. Officials described the three-week protest as an “occupation” of Ottawa’s downtown. Advertisement 20 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.

The Edmonton Oilers had a multi-leg journey beginning after their game Wednesday night, when the team flew from Edmonton to Vancouver where they stayed overnight in a hotel before bussing across the border to Washington State and then catching a plane to LA.

But two years into the pandemic, health officials in some countries are questioning the merits of repeated, mass testing when it comes to containing infections, particularly considering the billions it costs. Chief among them is Denmark, which championed one of the world’s most prolific COVID testing regimes early on. Lawmakers are now demanding a close study of whether that policy was effective.

Article content “We’ve tested so much more than other countries that we might have overdone it,” said Jens Lundgren, professor of infectious diseases at Rigshospitalet, University of Copenhagen, and member of the government’s COVID advisory group. Japan avoided large-scale testing and yet weathered the pandemic relatively well, based on infection and death rates. Other countries, including Britain and Spain, have scaled back testing. Yet repeated testing of entire cities remains a central part of the “zero-COVID” plan in China, where leaders have threatened action against critics. “We need to learn, and no one did it perfectly,” said Dale Fisher, chair of the World Health Organization’s Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network.

In fact, demand for hard currencies as a savings vehicle has gone in the opposite direction as demand reached its highest level in 60 years. Cash withdrawals surged at the onset of the pandemic as circulating notes increased twice as much as expected in 2020 and remained elevated in the following year, according to an April 14 Bank of Canada report. The Royal Bank of Canada noted in a May 9 report that cash was used more as a savings vehicle rather than for transactions. The Bank of Canada’s data tracking transactions found that the volume of cash purchases dropped precipitously from 54 per cent in 2009 to only 22 per cent in 2020.

Article content RBC analyst Josh Nye has a few reasons why Canadians are clutching onto cash: for one, there is an overall correlation with crises and the need to have hard cash on hand. Nye wrote that the demand for cash was pronounced over 20 years ago amid fears that the Y2K programming bug would wipe out the worldwide network of ATMs and digital payment systems. This “dash for cash” also resurfaced during the global financial crisis in 2008 when consumers were unsure of whether banks could stay afloat.

I would start by not telling the UCP government that they did a poor job handling COVID and that you (City of Edmonton) had a better handle on masking, et cetera, earlier in 2022. Insulting the hand that feeds is a poor strategy. Next time, try and put your liberal agenda aside and consider a more neutral approach.

Authorization for that age group would be an important regulatory step toward reaching about 28 million children for inoculation, most of them back in school for in-person learning. The vaccine could be available to the younger age group as soon as next week. The FDA is not obligated to follow the advice of its outside experts but usually does. Advertisement 4 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content If the FDA authorizes the shots for this age group, an advisory panel to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will meet next week to make a recommendation on the administration of the vaccine. The CDC director will make the final call. The companies have said their vaccine showed 90.7 per cent efficacy against the coronavirus in a clinical trial of children aged five to 11. While children becoming seriously ill or dying from COVID-19 is relatively rare compared with adults, some develop complications, and infections in unvaccinated kids have risen due to the easily transmitted Delta variant of the coronavirus. “To me, the question is pretty clear,” said Dr. Amanda Cohn, a pediatric vaccine expert at the CDC and a voting member of the panel. “We don’t want children to be dying of COVID, even if it is far fewer children than adults, and we don’t want them in the ICU.” Advertisement 5 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.

Article content 3 p.m. Around the world, governments are dropping local pandemic restrictions and border measures From the Bloomberg news agency: In places around the world where travellers have been locked out by border rules and local health prohibitions, COVID-19 travel restrictions are starting to fall. Bloomberg looked at public health restrictions from 40 cities around the world that have been tracked since early August, as well as 30 more cities tracked since mid-September. Each city in Bloomberg’s analysis gets a grade of “more open,” “moderately open” or “less open” based on measures such as capacity limits at restaurants and bars, mask rules and other criteria. On Aug. 10, only 33 per cent of cities had a “more open” grade. As of last week, 56 per cent of cities have that rating. The data are confirmation of what many people are seeing when they travel abroad or socialize near home — as vaccinations increase and governments adjust to a baseline level of cases, more places are dropping public-health measures and border rules, and business and leisure travel is coming back along with local life.

Article content In Italy, a government order allowed theatres, cinemas and concert halls to operate at 100 per cent capacity earlier this month. On Sunday, Saudi Arabia eased mask rules and dropped social distancing regulations for public places, transport, restaurants, cinemas, ahead of a large entertainment festival that runs through the spring. Not everything is completely back to normal. Brussels this month instituted a new requirement that people show proof of vaccination to enter many establishments, and masks are ubiquitous on service workers and required on public transportation. Nightclubs are back open, and larger private events are allowed again. But in the country’s Flanders region, the government is considering new mask rules for schoolchildren and encouraging working from home, after seeing a new wave of cases.

Article content The reopenings are happening in parallel with shifting attitudes about pandemic health priorities. A recent poll of residents in six countries — the U.S., U.K., Japan, Sweden, Germany and France — found growing support for the goal of “protect the economy” and mostly falling support for “limit the spread” of Covid. The increase in openness comes just as travel rules are loosening, as well. The U.S. plans to reopen its borders to vaccinated travellers beginning Nov. 8, a move that will almost certainly provide a boost to global business and leisure travel. EU countries have been reopening their borders since summer, including to arrivals from the U.S. The U.K. has likewise loosened its borders over the past month, joining EU neighbours.

Singapore, for example, announced plans earlier this month to open travel to vaccinated American and British travellers, and plans similar loosened rules for people from Switzerland and Australia. And in Sydney, the city of 6 million people has finally lifted lockdown rules after 107 days, as the government debates whether to reopen travel to visitors. There are exceptions, of course.

Dr. Cindy Friedman, chief of the travellers’ health branch of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, says clarity on the rules for land-border visitors is coming soon. Friedman says Customs and Border Protection is expected to announce in the next few days whether travellers crossing the land borders will need to show proof of a negative test.

Some 93 per cent of respondents whose kids trick-or-treated last year intend to have them go candy hunting again this Sunday, according to a new survey by Leger and the Association for Canadian Studies. But the online poll suggests fewer than half of Canadians will open their doors to trick-or-treaters due to COVID-19. Of the 56 per cent who checked no, half said they would typically dole out candy on Halloween but will not this time “given the current pandemic.” Advertisement 19 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content Leger executive vice-president Christian Bourque says some parents who kept their kids at home last year may allow them to hit the pavement on Oct. 31, given the high vaccination rates now versus the absence of vaccines a year ago. Either way, the poll figures suggest they’ll face a few more darkened doorways. “If you’re opening your door do you fear that you’re going to let the virus in? I don’t know,” Bourque said. “Usually you stay on the porch. “We’ve already bought the candy to open the door.” Many Canadians also trick or treat in condo and apartment buildings, where open-air interactions are not an option. Of the 447 respondents who had children of trick-or-treat age, 252 let them costume up and go porch to porch last year, with the vast majority of those planning the same for Sunday.

Here’s an explainer for American parents, via the Reuters news agency: When will COVID-19 vaccines be available for younger children? The shots are likely to be available early November. The Food and Drug Administration will consider the recommendation of a committee of outside advisers after that panel meets on Tuesday, and is likely to authorize the vaccine within days. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention director will make the final decision after a panel of expert advisors to the CDC meets to discuss the administration of the shots on Nov. 2 and 3. Advertisement 25 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content Where will the shots be available? Depending on the state, in pediatricians’ offices, pharmacies and schools. Is it the same vaccine as the adult one? Yes, but at a lower dose. Pfizer and BioNTech have asked for authorization of a 10-microgram dose of the vaccine, a third of the dose size given to people 12 and older. The vaccine is still a two-shot vaccine, with doses given around three weeks apart. What if my child is a small five-year-old or a big 11-year-old? Should they get the children’s dose? The dose is based on age and not weight, according to Brittany Kmush, an epidemiologist and professor at Syracuse University. “Vaccines are different than medication in the dosing strategy and it has more to do with the maturity of the immune system rather than weight or metabolism,” she said.

      "Britons are more likely than any other nationality to take up the offer of a coronavirus vaccine - while the French are the most sceptical. A global survey conducted in mid-January about vaccinations against COVID-19 found that around 81% of UK respondents said they would get their jabs. In France, just 44% of respondents said the same. Second most likely were the Danes at 79%, followed by 70% of Dutch people. Japan, Singapore and Germany showed weaker confidence - although they were still more willing than the French - with 46%, 48% and 54% of participants respectively saying they would get inoculated. The research, carried out by Imperial College London's Institute of Global Health Innovation (IGHI) and YouGov, is part of a global monitoring project on attitudes toward the vaccines. Advertisement It looked at 15 countries, mostly in Europe and did not include the USA or any countries in South America or Africa, and talked to 13,500 respondents from each. Over time, the study found attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccines have generally improved, with 54% of people overall saying in January they would get vaccinated if they were offered a dose in the next week, up 14% from November. Despite the hesitancy in France, the number of French respondents who said they would strongly agree to get a COVID jab has doubled between November and January. However, a separate study in December from the Jean Jaures Foundation found that just two out of five people trusted French health authorities for vaccine information, with less than half that number trusting the government.

Participants in Australia, Japan, South Korea and Singapore, however, saw willingness decrease between the same time period. Other findings included a decrease in worry about side effects in nine countries, with fewer than half of all respondents saying they were concerned about potential harm.

Federal Conservatives and their supporters have long been calling for the removal of vaccine mandates for domestic air travellers, public servants and those working in federally regulated industries. Tory MPs say rapid testing should be allowed for those who choose to be unvaccinated. They have dismissed the mandates, announced by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau before last summer’s federal election, as driving division in the country and threatening people’s livelihoods. Recently, Conservatives have pointed to provinces’ choices to drop their vaccine-passport rules along with remaining health restrictions, following the Omicron-driven wave of the pandemic when infections soared.

Article content Charest, however, said decisions about the federal mandates that remain in place should be made according to the advice of health professionals. “That’s why they’re there,” the Conservative leadership candidate said in a wide-ranging interview on Thursday with The Canadian Press. “We shouldn’t try to substitute our judgment to it. There is always an element of political judgment.” Charest tested positive for COVID-19 earlier this week. He said he believes Canadians are lacking guidance on what to expect in the months ahead and they deserve to know more so they can plan their lives. 2:05 p.m. Austria reimposes some coronavirus measures – including masks – to curb record cases On March 5, just under two weeks ago, Austria cancelled almost all pandemic restrictions, though people were still required to wear masks in some places.

Article content ABC News reported mask requirements would remain in place “where it is absolutely necessary to protect vulnerable groups,” including in public transport, essential shops and pharmacies. Today, Austria reimposed some measures, the Bloomberg news agency reports: Austria will broaden mandatory mask-wearing and shorten the quarantine for health care workers to curb record coronavirus infections and ensure hospitals continue to function. The government is stepping back from a decision to remove most restrictions after daily infections reached record highs and modelling points to elevated case counts for the next two weeks. Speaking to reporters on Friday, Johannes Rauch, appointed this month as Austria’s health minister, said intensive-care unit occupancy remained low, but that hospitals were struggling to care for all patients due to the number of doctors and nurses becoming infected.

Dr. Theresa Tam expects a rise in cases of COVID-19 as public health measures are lifted in Canada, but says severe outcomes in the country should be manageable.

However, it is expected that increase in hospitalization would be less than what we just saw,” said Tam, referencing the massive Omicron wave Canada is only now riding out. The Omicron wave of COVID-19 led to a new round of public health restrictions and school closures as hospitals were once again stressed to their limit to accommodate the huge number of cases coming through their doors. Since the peak in January, cases have been declining steadily and have since levelled off, with approximately 5,000 cases reported daily, and the number of people in hospital have begun to dwindle. The daily average number of people in hospital with COVID-19 declined by 11 per cent since last week, and the number of people in intensive care declined by 14 per cent.

Article content But even as Canada’s situation has stabilized, worrying trends have begun to emerge elsewhere in the world. The World Health Organization warned Tuesday that several regions have seen increases in cases in the Western Pacific, Africa and Europe. While deaths attributed to the virus are declining around the world, the Western Pacific region has seen a 12 per cent increase in people killed by COVID-19 in the last week. The renewed spread of COVID-19 abroad has been partially blamed on BA.2, a sublineage of the Omicron variant that has been dubbed “stealth Omicron.” Tam said the international data suggests BA.2 seeks out and targets people with poor immunity, including unvaccinated people without prior exposure to the Omicron variant.

Article content That’s why Canada may be in better stead, with an 85 per cent rate of fully vaccinated eligible people, to prevent hospitalizations “even if there’s a spring blip” in cases, Tam said. So far BA.2 is spreading relatively slowly in Canada, and accounted for about 22 per cent of cases as of Feb. 20. It doesn’t appear to cause more severe illness than other variants, Tam said. Canada is moving away from fixating on case counts in general, as it enters a “transition phase” of the pandemic, she said. While public health will continue to watch for geographically representative trends around the country and around the world, Tam said it will be keeping a much closer eye on hospitalizations and severe cases. Tam said the best way to prevent those outcomes is for as many people as possible to get a full slate of vaccines, including a booster.

Article content Currently, only about 56 per cent of adults over the age of 18 have received a booster shot, according to the federal public health agency. Tam said there is a particular gap among people in their 50s. “That would, I think, still be very relevant given the potential for an uptick as the public health measures are eased,” Tam said. Public health will be closely watching booster rates as the fall approaches, but generally, provinces are moving away from vaccine mandates as a way to incentivize people to get their next shot, she said. “We want Canadians to want to get it because it makes sense,” she said. 1:45 p.m. Public health director urges Montrealers to remain united as restrictions lifted La levée graduelle des mesures se poursuit.

Yes, it is a personal decision at this point where mandates are being removed, which is a difficult period of adjustment. But I would say, given the possibility of the uptick in cases (in Canada), it’s prudent to just wear a mask for now.” Responding to a question, Dr. Howard Njoo, the country’s deputy chief public health officer, said “wearing a mask is (an) individual protection measure that is very important and proven. And even if there isn’t a mandate or a requirement, I think it’s still a good idea, certainly in some contexts.” Njoo said: “If you’re in a plane, for example, it’s a closed space, we’re in there for a period of time with other passengers in close contact. I think even if there’s no mandate it’s a good idea to continue to wear a mask for individual protection.” Advertisement 15 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.

Masking rules are set to come to an end in most settings on Monday, but the Toronto District School Board had asked for an extension to gradually ease out of masking as students return from March Break. The board had cited concerns over low vaccination rates among children five to 11 years old, and the risk to immunocompromised students and staff, in making the request. The TDSB says the province’s top doctor, along with the Ministry of Education, responded Thursday and “reiterated their previous direction” on lifting mask mandates.

It is OK to be anxious about the coming weeks and it is also OK to be excited and hopeful,” the board said in a statement. “Please do what makes you feel comfortable during this time and please respect the individual choices that other people make.” As we head back to school following March Break, we remain committed to supporting a healthy, safe and respectful environment for all students and staff.

      "In a rare opportunity for the public to put their questions directly to a top government scientist, Sir Patrick Vallance appeared on Sky News to talk lockdown, vaccines and how soon we can return to a more normal life. The chief scientific adviser, a regular at Downing Street's coronavirus news briefings over the past nine months, also answered concerns regarding face masks, care homes and more. Here's a catch-up if you missed it. Live COVID news from UK and around the world Image: Sir Patrick Vallance has answered your questions If you could go back to March 2020, what measures would you recommend to government knowing then what you know now? Sir Patrick said there is definitely an advantage in hindsight, and we now know a lot more about the virus than we did at the start of the pandemic. But, after the government has repeatedly been accused of being too slow to impose restrictions, he admitted that \"waiting and watching simply doesn't work\". \"The lesson is go earlier than you think you want to, go harder than you think you want to, and go a bit broader than you think you want to in terms of applying the restrictions,\" he said. Intriguingly, he finished by quoting Einstein's definition of insanity as doing the same thing repeatedly \"and expecting different results\". Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 1:33 Need restrictions 'earlier, harder, broader' Will the government keep the lockdown for longer if coronavirus cases and deaths do not come down? And if so, how long will it last? While the vaccine rollout remains promising, Sir Patrick said it will not be able to do the \"heavy lifting\" yet in terms of bringing down cases - and at the moment, infections are still \"nowhere near where they need to be\". Refusing to put a date on when lockdown could be lifted, the chief scientific adviser made clear it is too early to be talking about relaxing restrictions. He also suggested it would be more of a \"slow release\" of lockdown, rather than a \"big bang\" which would see lots of restrictions lifted at once. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 1:01 'Vaccines won't do the heavy lifting' In a similar vein, Sir Patrick was asked how many people would need vaccinating before we can remove some restrictions The vaccines work to protect people from severe illness and reduce their chances of dying - but we do not yet know how well they can reduce transmission of the virus, Sir Patrick said. He pointed out that only one in eight people in the UK have had the virus, so there are still many people who do not have protective antibodies. But he did give a rough figure for how many people need to be vaccinated for collective immunity: 70%. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 2:34 Vaccine 'won't necessarily' stop infections Will we have periods every year where we need to go into lockdown again because people have not received their yearly top-up of the vaccine? It is \"quite likely\" we will need to be vaccinated regularly - annually or bi-annually - for \"at least a few years\", Sir Patrick said. We will also likely need to adjust the vaccine each year, as we currently do with flu vaccinations, but this will be planned ahead. The good news is that he expects we will be in a much better position by this winter as the vaccine will be rolled out across large numbers of the population. We can't assume there won't be any action needed this winter, but there will more likely be softer measures such as wearing masks, being sensible indoors and hand washing. \"I'll be very surprised if year on year we need to do more than that,\" Sir Patrick said. Image: Vaccines by Pfizer/BioNTech and Oxford/AstraZeneca are currently being used in the UK Israel has done some trials and disputes the UK's claim of 89% efficacy after the first dose of the Pfizer vaccine - they claim it to be more like 33%. What do you think of this? Sir Patrick's explanation for the discrepancy is that the figures from Israel were produced by looking at rates of infection in people who were given the jab 14 days ago. If we are looking at the vaccine's efficacy over a 28-day period, this would show around 50% protection overall. But we know already that the vaccine does not offer protection for the first 10 days, as the immune system is building up. So if we look at data from day 10 onwards - as the UK trials have done - it looks much closer to the 89% figure. He added that real-world data will look a little different to lab data as \"things are seldom as good as in clinical trials\". Image: Nadhim Zahawi has been tasked with leading the government's vaccine rollout Why have BAME people not been made a priority group for the vaccine, despite evidence they are at higher risk? It is crucial these groups are \"targeted\" and \"come forward\" for vaccination, Sir Patrick said. But the prioritisation is based on those at the highest risk and scientists believe the biggest risk factor is age. With a dose of a vaccine, PPE and use of lateral flow testing, is it relatively safe for indoor care home visits? \"I'm afraid my answer is, no, it's not safe,\" Sir Patrick replied firmly. He warned that relaxing rules in care homes would not be appropriate given the high community transmission and could risk \"the whole thing flaring up\". Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 3:26 Care staff in crisis mode at Sheffield nursing home How much protection do face masks offer? Masks are most effective at protecting those wearing them from spreading COVID-19 to others, Sir Patrick said. They are somewhat effective at protecting the mask-wearer too, but we are not sure to what extent yet. Even so, he made clear we must continue to wear masks. Image: Face masks are most useful in preventing indoor transmission When will wearing face masks be mandatory outdoors? Sir Patrick said face masks are most useful in indoor environments, such as shops and supermarkets. Although they can be useful outdoors where there is crowding, he said that \"frankly, there shouldn't be any crowding\" while we are in lockdown.

Article content 2:40 p.m. Courts will have to consider reasonableness of delays during COVID-19, experts say From The Canadian Press: Canadian courts grappling with the aftermath of pandemic closures and restrictions will have to parse out how much of the delays during COVID-19 should be deemed reasonable and unavoidable as more cases approach or exceed the maximum time frame set for criminal trials, experts say. The pandemic halted in-person court proceedings for months in many provinces over the last two years and put jury trials on hold for long periods of time, exacerbating existing backlogs. Measures such as virtual hearings were implemented to minimize the impact of the pandemic, though not all cases could proceed remotely. Advertisement 8 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content Rules setting a mandatory cap on the length of trials make exceptions for delays caused by unforeseen and unavoidable events. But as the pandemic stretches on, what meets that definition becomes less clear-cut, said Daniel Brown, a Toronto-based defence lawyer and vice-president of the Ontario Criminal Lawyers’ Association. In matters that predated the global health crisis, or that emerged during court closures, it’s usually clear which setbacks can be attributed to COVID-19, he said. “But what about the cases that came into the system afterwards but are still impacted by the fact that these … cases are eating up a lot of trial dates?” he said. Filling in for a colleague, Brown recently obtained a stay of proceedings on grounds of unreasonable delay in a sexual assault case that began during the brief window in which Ontario courts were fully operational in the fall of 2020, he said. Advertisement 9 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content When the case was ready for trial, the only available date was a year away, pushing it beyond the maximum time limit, he said. Before the pandemic, prosecutors would simply have asked the trial coordinator for an earlier date, Brown said. But that isn’t possible now because those dates are earmarked for older cases held up by COVID-19 disruptions, he said. Currently, the only available remedy when a case is deemed to have taken too long is a stay of proceedings. Cases that emerged during the pandemic are only now starting to approach the maximum threshold — 18 months for provincial court and 30 months for Superior Court, Brown said. Some are pre-emptively seeking a stay of proceedings through what’s known as an 11b application when given trial dates beyond that time frame, he said.

Article content “Over the next six to 12 months, it’ll be telling to see if there’s more cases than before getting stayed for delay,” Brown said. When the Supreme Court of Canada established mandatory time limits as part of its ruling in the R. v Jordan case, its goal was to create a “more streamlined test” for assessing trial delay, said Palma Paciocco, a professor at York University’s Osgoode Hall law school. But that system wasn’t designed with something like COVID-19 in mind, she said. Under the Jordan framework, delays caused by the defence are deducted from the total time of the case. After that, if the tally surpasses the established ceiling, it’s presumed to be an unreasonable delay, she said. The onus is then on the Crown to show the setbacks were caused by exceptional circumstances that couldn’t be mitigated, she said.

Article content However, that analysis focuses on what can reasonably be done to offset delays in a specific case, rather than across the judicial system, she said. It would be difficult for judges to critically assess the appropriateness of systemic responses to COVID-19 in considering delays in individual cases, she noted. 2:05 p.m. Foreign investment rebounded in 2021 to set record: Montreal International After a one-year slump caused by COVID-19, foreign investment in the Montreal region rebounded in a big way, setting a record in the process.

Some 2.7 million Germans aged 60 and older haven’t been vaccinated, leaving them at greater risk of becoming severely ill. Meanwhile, the war in Ukraine has distracted public attention from the pandemic, and contagion rates have again been rising across Europe. The incidence rate climbed to almost 2,770 in the Netherlands and Austria and more than 2,000 in Switzerland. In the U.K., the rate is just below 580, while in France it’s at 616 and in Italy 505. Lauterbach has said Germany is facing a critical situation even as many appear to believe that the pandemic is effectively over and are eschewing measures like social distancing and mask wearing in public places.

People can drop off the equipment at several locations, including the town hall, community centre and rink, the town said in a statement today. The initiative is a partnership with a company called MultiRecycle. “Masks will be separated into three different parts: filter, elastics, and nose clips,” Montreal West said. “The nose clip will be recycled as it is made from fully recyclable aluminum.

      "The government is \"very concerned\" about low uptake of the coronavirus jab among black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) communities, the vaccines minister has told Sky News. Speaking to Sophy Ridge on Sunday, Nadhim Zahawi said overall COVID-19 vaccine acceptance was \"very high\", with data from the Office for National Statistics showing 85% of adults were very likely to take up the offer of a jab. Latest COVID updates from the UK and around the world Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 5:57 Hesitancy and mistrust in the COVID vaccine But Mr Zahawi said the remaining 15% \"skew heavily towards BAME communities and especially Afro-Caribbean, black communities and of course other Asian and BAME communities\". \"If one particular community remains unvaccinated, then the virus will seek them out and it will go through that community like wildfire and that's not something any of us wish to see,\" he said. Advertisement As a result, Mr Zahawi said, \"you'll hear more on this from me in the coming days\" about how the government will try to increase the take-up of jabs among those from BAME communities. He added: \"We know the level of uptake and to focus on those groups we need to focus on to make sure we get the hard to reach groups. \"This is an important issue. We are focusing on it and you will see more from us, with the NHS, so we deliver for all communities.\" He was speaking after new data released by the Royal College of GPs - and shared with Sky News - found that 90% of vaccine doses administered so far have been given to white people. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 2:29 Ethnic minorities targeted by anti-vaxxers It found that people of mixed ethnicity, Asian and black are, respectively, approximately only 33, 47 and 64% as likely to receive a jab as white people. The group is calling for a nationwide campaign, backed by faith leaders and prominent BAME public figures, to try to increase vaccine take-up. Professor Martin Marshall, chair of the Royal College of GPs, said: \"The COVID vaccines are set to get us out of this pandemic, but increasing the uptake of the vaccine amongst black, Asian and minority ethnic patients will require more than the efforts of GPs and their teams. \"If prominent figures from BAME communities work with the NHS to help bust the myths around the COVID vaccine and help deliver clear and relevant messages about its safety, it may very well save lives.\" During his Sky News interview, Mr Zahawi also discussed his concerns around anti-vaccination messages on social media. \"We set up a unit across government that looks at all the anti-vax messages and alerts the social media platforms to them to help take them down as quickly as possible,\" he said. \"We want them to do as much as they can, as quickly as they can, and we'll continue to work with them very closely, but we can always do more because there is too much.\" :: Listen to Sophy Ridge on Sunday on Apple podcasts, Google podcasts, Spotify, Spreaker Mr Zahawi said people concerned about vaccines should get information from their GPs, particularly black and ethnic minority groups. \"I've done numerous roundtables with black and ethnic minority practitioners, nurses, doctors, who have been jabbed themselves, because the best experience is from someone you trust that's already taken the vaccine,\" he said.\n",

Rupa Subramanya: Liberals slow to realize vaccine mandates are past their best by date Time for the Trudeau government to end its vaccine mandate for federal employees Photo by Getty Images Article content At a press conference on Oct. 6, 2021, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland announced mandatory vaccination in federally regulated workplaces and sectors, including for passengers boarding a plane or a train. Trudeau said his government’s two-dose vaccine mandates for travellers and for federal government employees, who continued to work from home, were amongst the “strongest in the world.” Advertisement 2 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.

Try refreshing your browser, or Rupa Subramanya: Liberals slow to realize vaccine mandates are past their best by date Back to video The Trudeau government justified the mandates by stating that mandatory vaccinations would “reduce the risk of COVID-19, prevent future outbreaks, and better protect the health of Canadians.” Freeland said vaccines “prevent the spread of COVID-19; they significantly reduce the severity of cases, and, most importantly, they save lives.” From these and similar statements made by Trudeau, his ministers, and officials, it’s abundantly clear that the Trudeau government was, principally, referring to vaccines reducing transmission of the virus from person to person, and, secondarily, that vaccines would reduce the severity of the disease and the risk of mortality. At the time of the announcement in October 2021, approximately 89 per cent of eligible Canadians had received one vaccine dose and around 82 per cent of those eligible had received both doses, according to Freeland.

Article content More On This Topic Rupa Subramanya: Doug Ford must resist COVID zero zealots Matt Gurney: Liberals reach for another vaccine mandate The federal government’s vaccine mandates were implemented before the discovery of the highly transmissible Omicron variant, which has proven to be a game changer. The new variant has proven to be more adept than the original virus or the deadly Delta variant at “evading” immunity acquired through vaccination or natural immunity acquired through infection. Considering that Omicron generally leads to a higher infection rate, given its greater transmissibility, yet also to less severe symptoms than earlier variants, many jurisdictions around the world that had imposed stringent vaccine mandates have rethought them, along with a rethink of the role of mask mandates and of lockdowns. Advertisement 4 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content Most Canadian provinces, excluding British Columbia and Newfoundland, have cancelled vaccine mandates for their own employees, as well as for restaurant dining and so forth, and all have cancelled mask mandates for most locations. The government of Canada is a notable exception in the advanced world in thus far having failed to rethink its vaccine mandate for federal employees. For example, Austria suspended a controversial mandate in early March that it had introduced in mid-February but had promised to not start enforcing for a month. That law would have made vaccinations mandatory for everyone, with fines running as high as €3,600 or nearly $5,000. Despite a surge in infections in March, even “COVID-zero” New Zealand announced, effective April 4, the ending of vaccine mandates for teachers, police officers and members of its military, while continuing to require vaccination for workers in the health sector, those caring for the elderly, and for those working in the prison sector. Advertisement 5 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content Even 'COVID-zero' New Zealand ended mandates It’s noteworthy that these two countries were at very different rates of full vaccination when they cancelled (or largely cancelled) their mandates: Austria was at about 70 per cent and New Zealand at a very high 95 per cent. Compare this to Canada, which, at the time of the vaccine mandate announcement in the fall of 2021, was already sitting at about 82 per cent of people fully vaccinated. In other words, when Canada imposed its mandates, more of the population was already fully vaccinated than in Austria, when it ditched its mandates. What’s more, Canada, unlike many European countries, never recognized proof of recovery from infection as a legitimate alternative to vaccination. The number of people involved is not trivial. According to a Canadian Blood Services report for March 2022, an estimated 30 per cent of unvaccinated blood donors showed evidence that they had been recently infected by COVID-19, while 18 per cent of vaccinated donors had evidence of recent infection. According to the COVID-19 Immunity Task Force, about 30 per cent of all blood donors by the end of March showed infection-acquired seropositivity and a recent serosurvey by Héma-Québec estimated that more than 25 per cent of adults in the province had antibodies acquired through infection during the first Omicron wave ending in March. Advertisement 6 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content It’s clear to everyone, apparently except the federal government of Canada, that vaccine mandates based on the original two-dose vaccine regimen were never meant to be permanent. Countries and sub-national jurisdictions that imposed vaccine mandates, therefore, periodically reviewed them, and, as we’ve seen, many countries are now getting rid of them altogether, based on the already high rate of vaccination and the latest scientific evidence based on the now dominant Omicron variant. Vaccine mandates ... were never meant to be permanent Most obviously, it is well established that vaccine effectiveness wanes over time, and, since most Canadians received their second dose sometime in the summer or fall of 2021, the effectiveness of the two-dose regimen that the government mandated is now very low. There is little made-in-Canada evidence to speak to this, but, in its latest surveillance report, dated May 12, the UK Health Security Agency, a public health agency tasked with protecting public health from the impacts of infectious diseases, shows that after two doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine, vaccine effectiveness against the Omicron variant drops to “no effect” within 25 weeks after the second dose. Similarly, with two doses of Pfizer or Moderna, vaccine effectiveness went from around 65 to 70 per cent after the second dose to as low as 15 per cent by 25 weeks. Further, two to four weeks after the third or “booster” dose of either Pfizer or Moderna, vaccine effectiveness ranged from 60 to 75 per cent, but then plunged dramatically to having no effect whatever after 20 or more weeks. Advertisement 7 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content Unless the federal government is contemplating mandating the third and subsequent booster doses, putting Canadians on a never-ending carousel of vaccination, it’s clear that the utility of the vaccine mandates based on the original two doses has now run its course. No advanced western country has thus far mandated boosters, and even the Canadian government, which loves mandates, hasn’t talked about it. Many experts believe that fourth and subsequent booster doses are unnecessary for most normal healthy people and shouldn’t be mandated. What we have left now are meaningless vaccine mandates based on the original two doses. It’s time for them to be scrapped, period.

Try refreshing your browser, or Rupa Subramanya: Time to lift the federal government's outdated and unnecessary vaccine mandates Back to video Vaccine rules are much less stringent in most other major western countries. Austria, which announced that it was going to mandate vaccines for everyone last fall, recently withdrew the mandate before it came into force, arguing that it is not needed at this time due to the milder illness caused by the Omicron variant. A similar vaccine mandate being considered in Germany, which has proved extremely controversial within the governing coalition, has not been implemented and likely won’t be. In that country, except in the health sector, vaccination is not mandatory for federal government employees. The list goes on. Canada has indeed the most stringent federal vaccine mandate as they apply to federal civil servants of any G7 country. Advertisement 3 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content In the United States, President Joe Biden’s sweeping federal vaccine mandates, meant to apply to federal workers as well as to private businesses that employ 100 or more people, are in shambles, as they’ve been aggressively challenged in court, and judges have suspended most of the mandates as the challenges work their way through the judicial system. Earlier this month, the Justice Department argued before a federal appeals court that the mandate on federal workers was within the president’s executive authority as the head of the government’s workforce, but this contention was challenged by the attorney representing a group of federal workers who argued that the administration exceeded its authority in implementing it. While the challenge is under review, the mandate remains suspended. Advertisement 4 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content Biden’s difficulties in ramming through federal vaccine mandates via executive orders stands in sharp contrast to the situation here in Canada, where legal challenges to federal and provincial vaccine mandates have enjoyed little success. Canadians, meanwhile, have largely acquiesced to some of the most stringent vaccine mandates and other COVID-related restrictions on individual liberty in the world. In part, this is a reflection of our legal system, which gives much greater leeway to government-imposed mandates and restrictions than in the U.S., but it also reflects a Canadian culture of compliance, which was only challenged recently during the Freedom Convoy protests. Indeed, despite all the protestations to the contrary, the accelerated removal of vaccine passports and other restrictions at the provincial level arguably reflects the influence of the protesters. Advertisement 5 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content According to reports, as of April 4, Ontario will no longer insist on proof of vaccination or a recent negative COVID test for provincial civil servants. In Nova Scotia, provincial civil servants who had refused vaccination can return to work on March 21, except for those who work in the health-care sector. What is truly ironic about the vaccine mandate imposed on the federal workforce is that Canada tops the list of major countries in which public servants continue to work remotely. The Global Government Forum, in a survey conducted between January and February, found that 70 per cent of Canadian civil servants were working remotely, compared to an average of 48 per cent in the 10 countries surveyed. It surely is bizarre that unvaccinated federal employees who are working from home have been placed on leave without pay, even though they’re not coming into their offices. And many civil servants will likely continue working remotely for some time to come. Advertisement 6 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content According to the Treasury Board President Mona Fortier, the minister responsible for federal civil servants, the return to the workplace will be phased in incrementally. It’s unlikely that very many workers will return well before the fall. That would mean that some federal employees will have been on leave without pay for nearly half a year, even though they were fully capable of doing their job safely from home. This is about as Kafkaesque as it gets. Given that the provincial governments and many of our peer countries are removing their pandemic restrictions and starting to find ways to live with the virus, it’s extraordinary that the Canadian government refuses to acknowledge this reality and modify its policies accordingly.

Over the last three months, 96 per cent of people between the ages of 19 and 29 who were infected with COVID-19 weren’t vaccinated against the virus, Dr. Kieran Moore said. Ninety-nine per cent of infected people between the ages of 12 and 17 were unvaccinated. Advertisement 4 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content “That age group is coming down with a higher rate of disease than other age groups across Ontario,” Moore said. “They’re a key metric, because they’re the ones that are going to be going to high schools, to colleges, to universities, to workplaces, and potentially, unbeknownst to them, if they’re carrying the virus without symptoms, spreading it in those environments.” He added that young Ontarians will be a “key target” in the vaccination campaign going forward. “We’ve been on calls with the local public health agencies and immunization partners around the province who are seeing this lack of uptake in the younger age groups and are looking at ways to encourage them to step forward,” he said. 4:35 p.m. In the U.S., cases are rising again after months of decline U.S. COVID-19 cases are rising again after months of decline.

Article content 4:15 p.m. Trudeau defends Canada’s early response to COVID-19 but admits room for improvement From The Canadian Press: Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says there are ways to improve Canada’s early pandemic alert and response systems, but insists Canada’s top public health officials did start building a national response to COVID-19 very early on. Trudeau says he welcomes a report the government commissioned reviewing Canada’s Global Public Health Intelligence Network, known as GPHIN, which was published Monday. Health Minister Patty Hajdu ordered the review last year after concerns some Public Health Agency of Canada scientists raised concerns that early warnings about COVID-19 were ignored. The three-member review team led by former national security adviser Margaret Bloodworth says GPHIN could not have alerted Canadian officials to the existence of unexplained cases of pneumonia in China any earlier than it did.

Speaking to reporters at a child-care announcement in Nova Scotia, Trudeau was asked about jurisdictions, including France, Greece and Italy, that are requiring health care workers to get vaccinated. Advertisement 7 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content In his response, Trudeau said there is no need for Canada to follow suit because Canadians have voluntarily embraced vaccines. Canada will continue to press the message that “in order to get back to a more normal way of living in Canada, everybody should get vaccinated,” he said. Trudeau said “what we’ve seen right across the country from the very beginning is Canadians stepping up to get vaccinated in record numbers. “We’re leading the world in terms of first dose and we’re catching up with the world leaders in terms of fully vaccinated Canadians.” He said variants are a cause of concern, noting that there are new spikes in COVID-19 cases in some areas, including Europe. Trudeau added: “The reality is that we are going to continue to do what is necessary – giving Canadians information, making it easy to get vaccinated, and I am certain that we’re going to continue to see numbers climbing across Canada as more and more people get their full vaccination doses.“ Advertisement 8 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content However, Canada still has “a lot of work to do to get to a situation in the fall where we can have a more normal, more safe situation,” he said. Trudeau was also asked whether the federal government has a role to play in helping create a standardized vaccine passport that can be used within Canada’s borders. Quebec says it plans to have a vaccine passport in place by Sept. 1 that could be used to bar the unvaccinated from obtaining non-essential services in the event of outbreaks. Today, Toronto’s board of trade urged Ontario to introduce passports, suggesting they are needed to safely reopen big events such as business conferences and to revive tourism. Alberta has ruled out bringing in a vaccine passport. In his response, Trudeau said that “different provinces will be doing different things. Where the federal government has a role to play is in terms of vaccine certification for international travel.” Advertisement 9 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.

Article content 1:45 p.m. French retailers puzzle over how to keep non-vaccinated shoppers from stores French retailers were puzzled on Tuesday over how a new government proposal requiring them to block people not vaccinated against COVID-19 from shopping malls could possibly work out in practice, the Reuters news agency reports. Ahead of a meeting with Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire on Wednesday, retailers said that a widening of COVID health pass requirements announced by President Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday was difficult to implement. In a bid to slow down the spread of the virus, Macron said a health pass would be required from July 21 to enter places of leisure and culture and that from early August it would be required in bars and restaurants, shopping malls, hospitals as well as in planes and long-distance trains and buses. Advertisement 12 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content A health pass would have to show double vaccination against COVID-19, recovery from the illness or a recent negative test. “The government did not want to make vaccination mandatory for all and puts the onus on private companies,” retail federation FCD chief Jaques Creyssel said on C-News TV. He said it was hard to imagine how anyone could stop a customer who needed to buy food or medicines. He added that the industry has a lot of young staff, many of whom are not vaccinated and that given that it takes about one and a half months to get two doses, it was not feasible to get everyone ready by early August. “We hope the law to be voted on will make clear that public authorities will be in charge of controlling access, because we cannot do this ourselves,” he said.

Article content The head of French retailer System U, Dominique Schelcher, said on his Twitter account that putting in place a health pass system at the entrance of a supermarket would raise many issues, such as who is in charge of control, what to do in case of conflict and what to do with non-vaccinated workers. He also said that the new measure would only impact shopping malls, not small neighbourhood supermarkets. 1 p.m. U.S. officials say fully vaccinated don’t need booster From the Reuters news agency: U.S. health officials, after meeting with vaccine maker Pfizer, reiterated on Monday that Americans who have been fully vaccinated do not need to get a booster shot, a spokesperson for the Health and Human Services Department said.

Due to the pandemic, there were severe restrictions on events such as marriages during much of 2020. “The decline in marriages began in March 2020 and was particularly pronounced in early summer, the season in which the majority of the year’s weddings are normally celebrated,” the provincial statistics institute said.

      "Introduction This is a companion paper, which provides underpinning evidence to support the CMA publication, Online Choice Architecture: how digital design can harm competition and consumers (referred to as “the discussion paper”). Online choice architecture (OCA) describes the environment in which users act and make decisions, including the presentation and placement of choices and the design of interfaces. OCA is often used positively to help consumers, for example, by displaying relevant products prominently and to streamline friction. Competition and consumer authorities necessarily need to identify and address detriment, so this paper focuses on the harms that can arise from OCA practices. This paper is intended to be used as a reference document. It provides summaries of the evidence on 21 OCA practices (for example, defaults), organised into 3 sections: Choice Structure, Choice Information, Choice Pressure. For each of the practices, the paper: describes what the practice is considers the effects on consumers and businesses and diagnoses the underlying causes of harm from the practice assesses the competition and consumer harm considers potential remedies The paper also outlines the evidence on prevalence of OCA practices as well as selected cross-cutting issues related to OCA, for example vulnerability of consumers. There will be a range of audiences for this paper including those working in competition and consumer authorities, academics, practitioners including designers and technologists, as well as those working within and advising businesses. The paper is not intended to be exhaustive but provides a review of the evidence available at the time of publication. This paper is not intended to act as guidance for businesses and their advisors, or to determine how the CMA will act in future cases and investigations where OCA plays a role, especially with regards to remedies. Online commerce brings great benefits to businesses and consumers. For consumers, the move to digital markets has reduced friction, increased transparency and comparability and opened access to a truly global marketplace. Additionally, digital markets have dramatically reduced entry barriers for some types of business, heightened competition and provides any business with access to a global pool of customers. However, rapid growth in this area also presents risks to the wellbeing of consumers and markets. Even though there are many similarities with the offline setting, consumers may behave differently online: they may act more quickly, have shorter attention spans, skim rather than read (Delgado et al., 2018; Duggan and Payne, 2011), direct their attentional focus narrowly and ignore substantial amounts of content (Pernice, 2017), and rely more on recommendations from strangers (Benartzi and Lehrer, 2015). The nature of online markets can induce more impulsive behaviours, reach further into people’s social interactions and media consumption, and lead to more intensive advertising exposure (Danish Competition and Consumer Authority, 2020; Fletcher et al., 2021). Moreover, selling online gives businesses the necessary control to personalise and optimise almost every aspect of their interactions with consumers systematically at scale (Kohavi and Thomke, 2017). Choice architecture describes the contexts in which consumers make decisions and how choices are presented (Johnson, 2022; Thaler et al., 2010). For example, think of the supermarket shelves closest to the checkout where customers have to linger, waiting to buy their items. The person who designs the layout of the store has a choice about what to put there. Should they choose the best-selling, highest margin items, like chocolate and gum? Or should they display healthy snack bars and fruit, which might be better for consumers’ welfare? Designers like these, or “choice architects”, make those decisions every day; their choices influence consumers’ decisions and businesses’ bottom lines. Choice architects face the same questions when designing online environments, often with the benefit of being able to measure the effect of their interventions quickly and easily. For example, where should the “Buy” button be positioned relative to the “Back” button? How many clicks should there be to buy something rather than to return it? Should product options be ordered by relevance, price, popularity, or something else? This gives choice architects a potential advantage when selling their products, compared to consumers who may not even realise they are being influenced and their behaviour measured. There is evidence that businesses put considerable effort into designing the choice architecture of their websites, and that they test different versions in real-life field trials (Ghosh, 2021). In online settings, choice architecture is the environment in which users act, including the presentation and placement of choices and the design of interfaces. This is described in this paper as online choice architecture (OCA). OCA can be and frequently used positively (for example Sobolev, 2021), for example intentionally used by businesses to create smooth customer journeys, help match people with suitable products, or reduce waiting time. However, it can also be used in ways that are not in the interests of consumers and has the potential to weaken competition. This is not always the case – many practices can be used in both positive and negative ways. A seamless purchase process, for example enabling a product to be bought in one click, may be positive for consumers and may save them time and effort. However, it might also induce impulsive, unwanted, and possibly accidental purchases, which could harm consumers and potentially weaken competition. In this paper, some of the practices described may be used positively (and sometimes may even have positive some effects for consumers, but negative effects on competition or vice versa). However, the focus is mainly on the use of practices in situations that cause harm for consumers and/or competition. This paper provides a detailed summary of the literature on a range of OCA practices and their effects. It positions the practices within a proposed taxonomy, and identifies the literature on the prevalence of particular forms of OCA. For discussions about OCA practices and their effects in relation to consumers and competition, the potential harms are considered in detail; that is, practices applied in situations that reduce consumer welfare, weaken competition, or enable businesses to gain or exploit market power. Harmful OCA can also make decisions unnecessarily complex for consumers, and create friction that makes it difficult for people to make decisions in their best interest. In the wider literature, there are several interlinked terms that cover some aspects of OCA practices, including “sludge”, “dark patterns”, and “dark nudge”. Sludge is excessive or unjustified friction that makes it difficult for consumers to get what they want or to do as they wish (Sunstein, 2020). This could include, for example, requiring customers to telephone a premium rate number to cancel a subscription or hiding important information about a product in the terms and conditions. It is important to note that not all friction is sludge. Friction can be helpful and may be deployed by policymakers to slow down thinking in high-stakes decisions where mistakes are common, or even by conscientious businesses who care about consumers making properly informed choices. For example, gambling rules often require consumers to go through a waiting period before attendance after signing up at a casino, or impose additional financial limits of the maximum amount that can be deposited into a temporary account to discourage impulse gambling at vulnerable moments (Carran, 2018). Dark patterns as a concept originated in the user experience (UX) design practitioner community, and was later adopted by the computer science and Human–Computer Interaction community (Gray et al., 2018). Dark patterns designate “user interface design choices that benefit an online service by coercing, steering, or deceiving users into making unintended and potentially harmful decisions” (Mathur et al., 2019). This includes, for example, “confirmshaming”, where a user is shamed into compliance through the wording of the “reject” option – for example having to click “No, I don’t care about charity” to avoid donating. Dark patterns often consist of multiple OCA practices combined as part of a user’s online experience. For instance, ‘sneak into basket” practices can be viewed as a combination of pre-checked defaults, sensory manipulation and sludge. Dark nudges are practices where a choice architect makes it easy or removes friction for consumers to make inadvertent or ill-considered decisions. For example, Newall (2019) identified dark nudges in the gambling industry, for example: (a) optimising the gambler’s experience by using modern electronic machines with touchscreen buttons to reduce the physical effort of long gambling sessions; and (b) exploiting gamblers’ cognitive biases (for example the tendency to overestimate the likelihood of highly specific events) to nudge them towards risky bets. Another example of a dark nudges is subscription trap, where a consumer can easily sign up for a free product or service but is not clearly told that they have enrolled in an ongoing payment arrangement after the initial free period expires. Figure 1 shows the overlap between different terms and the relationship between these concepts, adopted for the purposes of this paper. Figure 1. Online Choice Architecture covers a wide range of terms, including most dark patterns as well as all dark nudges and sludge Figure 1 description: Is a Venn diagram depicting Online Choice Architecture as an umbrella term for practices such as sludge, dark patterns, and dark nudges. In certain events, dark pattern practices can overlap with sludge, dark nudges and offline choice architecture. This paper uses a broad definition of OCA to enable discussion of a wider set of practices across a range of contexts. Carefully designed use of OCA is frequently beneficial to consumers and can be utilised in remedies. In addition, whilst the focus of the discussion in this paper is on harmful applications, it also covers practices where non-deliberate use may cause harm. However, the impact is often the same, regardless of intention. For this reason, this paper does not differentiate between intentional and unintentional applications of OCA. Additionally, some practices, such as those classified within dark patterns, are likely intended to be harmful or deceptive all the time (for example, drip pricing), whereas other practices can be harmful in certain circumstances regardless of intention (for example, ranking). A few dark patterns may fall outside the OCA taxonomy because they do not involve choice architecture (for example, friend spam, where automatic messages are sent to members of a user’s network without their permission). This paper places OCA in its wider context when discussing the literature related to cross-cutting topics. One such cross-cutting topic of particular importance is the interaction of algorithms and OCA. For example, the use of algorithms underpins the ordering and display of search results, and algorithms can facilitate personalisation of online choice architecture (Competition and Markets Authority, 2021a). In addition, choice architects may have multiple data-driven ways to measure the effectiveness of OCA, including through large-scale “A/B testing”. These tests detect the responses of real consumers accessing different versions of the website or app, and enable the business to determine the most effective version at a glance (Kohavi and Thomke, 2017). This paper is a synthesis of the existing academic literature and available reports from other competition and consumer protection authorities and other experts. Some practices are described together with relevant CMA (or other regulators’) cases and market studies. All cases mentioned function merely as examples and do not represent an exhaustive list of all the past and ongoing cases from CMA and various other regulators and authorities across the world. There are also practices with evidence of impact on consumer behaviour, but where the potential for consumer harm is not yet well established in the literature. It is important to note that circumstances and context may vary, and that knowledge of the specific context is required when the documented practices are applied to a particular case or market study. The examples mentioned set out in this paper are indications of concerns that have arisen in previous investigations or cases by public authorities and how they were examined and addressed in those cases. In instances where matters were resolved by businesses giving voluntary undertakings to the CMA about future practices, this was given without admission of liability. The terms “consumer” and “businesses” are used broadly, for example when describing how a particular practice might have affected consumer behaviour or when discussing businesses’ incentives for using different OCA practices. In addition, while this paper focuses on OCA practices as they affect consumers, it is also plausible that businesses, especially those run by individuals, might themselves be subject to OCA practices other businesses use. Structure of the paper The first section of this paper sets out: a proposed taxonomy for OCA practices that divides 21 specific practices into 3 broad types: choice structure; choice information; and choice pressure an overview of the literature on the general effectiveness of online choice architecture, including when multiple practices are used a discussion of the prevalence of OCA practices with reference to academic work, including studies using data science as well as work by consumer and competition authorities In the second section of the paper, there is a further discussion of the literature and relevant reports under 4 themes (description of practice; effect on consumers; potential harms; and potential remedies) for each of the 21 specific OCA practices. In the final section of the paper, there is a discussion of cross-cutting topics that are linked to OCA practices, their effectiveness, potential harms and the tools that are available to choice architects. The cross-cutting topics are: algorithms and how they interact with OCA, for example in the ranking of search results online privacy and the impact of OCA practices, including the use of defaults and data privacy choice screens business models and examples of how OCA has been used in different online contexts consumer vulnerability, why some consumer groups are more susceptible to harm, and why OCA practices may have a greater impact in certain situations or contexts consumer attention and how it relates to OCA the interaction of OCA with consumer awareness, learning, and trust In addition, the accompanying discussion paper provides a brief summary of the taxonomy, the evidence described in this paper and some of the cross-cutting issues. It also provides further discussion of the types of harm that can arise from OCA, illustrated with case studies of investigations by the CMA and others. Structure of discussion for each OCA practice For each of the 21 OCA practices identified within the taxonomy, 4 themes are discussed: Describing OCA practices How is the OCA practice defined? What are some real-world examples of the practice? Effects on consumers and businesses, and potential underlying causes How does the OCA practice affect consumers and businesses? Which underlying behavioural biases can be identified? Assessing consumer competiton and harm How does the OCA practice harm consumers and competition? Potential remedies Which remedies are suggested by the literature to reduce harm caused by the specific OCA practice? How have regulators taken OCA practices into account in investigations, analyses and cases? Below, there is a discussion about the approach to each theme. For some practices, the literature focuses on the practice’s effects; fewer studies focus on the potential consumer or competition harms or potential remedies. Where relevant, these limitations within the existing literature are noted for each practice. The rating strength of academic evidence underlying each practice has been based on Ruggeri, Linden, Wang, Papa, Afif, Riesch and Green’s (2020) table of evidence standards, also known as THEARI (Theoretical Empirical Applicable Replicable and Impact) rating system. These ratings of the strength of the evidence are an assessment of the extent and quality of available academic research relating to each identified practice, and should not be seen as conclusive. These ratings are collated in Table 1 within the taxonomy section of this paper. Describing OCA practices For each practice, this theme describes the practice with references to the key literature that identified it. The section also includes real-world examples to illustrate the practice. While the focus here is mainly on how practices can cause harm, OCA practices that can be used to benefit consumers are also discussed. For some practices, such as prompts and reminders, parts of the literature have heavily focused on contexts where the intention of the intervention was to be beneficial rather than harmful to the consumers. Effects on consumers and businesses, and potential underlying causes For each OCA practice, this theme explores the literature that examines OCA’s psychological effects on consumers, including on self-efficacy, regret and other emotions. The theme also considers why and to what extent the OCA practice can be effective, including how the practice relates to underlying behavioural biases. There are some common types of behaviours that are relevant to multiple OCA practices, and that OCA can influence. For consumers, examples of these effects are: Purchase behaviour “Actions taken by a consumer (including both to act, and not to act) concerning whether, how, and on what terms to purchase, make payment in whole or in part for, retain, or dispose of a product and/or a service, or whether, how, and on what terms to exercise a contractual right in relation to a product and/ or a service” (Velentzas et al., 2012). Shopping-around behaviour Actions taken by a consumer when in the process of looking for information about a particular product or service, such as scrolling down a webpage, reading terms and conditions, comparing and exploring different options, such as looking for more products if the initial set of products does not seem satisfactory on the same platform, or comparing different platforms to find the best deal (for example price comparison websites). Switching behaviour Actions taken by a consumer when deciding to move from the current service or brand and change to a new one, such as moving between 2 different mobile operating systems, or changing energy providers. The behaviours mentioned above can range from the simple (for example, a 1-click purchase) to more complex (for example, comparing multiple products simultaneously and trying to decide which one is the best fit), or from a fast decision (for example, impulsive purchase) to a deliberate slow-paced action (for example, reading customer reviews before purchasing) and other dimensions (for example, low vs. high monetary value). In behavioural science literature, there are several related and interlinked mechanisms that may explain the effects noted across the OCA practices: behaviour is often described as the result of 2 interconnected cognitive systems – a fast, automatic, intuitive-driven “System 1” and a reflective, slower, more deliberative “System 2” (Kahneman, 2011). Errors of judgment may occur when people rely on their System 1 to make fast decisions in cases where it might have been better to slow down and think. For example, choice architecture practices, such as false or misleading scarcity claims (stating that there is limited supply of a product when there is not), use pressure to encourage consumers to rely on their fast System 1 for decision making, rather than slowing down and engaging the more analytical System 2 (Kahneman, 2011) however, some studies that considered the effect of “nudges” studied their impact in relation to System 1 and 2; small seemingly inconsequential changes to contexts that nonetheless affect behaviour work similarly under System 1 conditions as under System 2 conditions (Hunter et al., 2019; Steffel et al., 2016; Venema et al., 2019). This means that “nudges” may still be effective when consumers have more time to deliberate about their choices (for example, when System 2 is activated) (Steffel et al., 2016) academic research has identified a range of specific behavioural biases that can affect a consumer’s online decision making (Gabaix and Laibson, 2006a; Luguri and Strahilevitz, 2021b; Sunstein, 2020). Examples include: status quo effect (ie the tendency to avoid change) increases consumers’ tendency, for a range of reasons, to stick with default settings that are presented to them (Kahneman et al., 1991). present bias (ie the tendency to prefer to settle for a smaller present reward than to wait for a larger future reward) regret aversion (ie the tendency to fear that the decision will turn out to be wrong in hindsight) may cause consumers to overreact to time-limited offers; choice architects can leverage this myopia to encourage instant gratification (O’Donoghue and Rabin, 2015; Zeelenberg and Pieters, 2004) Assessing consumer and competition harm Good choice architecture can bring significant benefits to markets and consumers. Firms in markets where consumers are active are under competitive pressure to make their customers’ journeys as easy and pleasing as possible. They also have an incentive to avoid damaging their reputation or trust among consumers resulting from using of manipulative practices. Choice architects will therefore tend to focus their skill on designing an environment to optimise the customer experience. However, given that competition and consumer agencies are responsible for identifying and remedying harm, this paper will focus on how OCA used by businesses and their designers can cause harm. OCA, if harmful, can make it difficult for consumers to make decisions in their own best interest, which may enable businesses to extract profits and build market power without doing so on their merits (Day and Stemler, 2019). In this paper, and illustrated in more detail with case studies in the discussion paper, there are 3 potential ways in which different OCA practices can cause harm: OCA practices can distort consumers’ behaviour. Influenced by OCA, people may purchase unneeded or unsuitable products, spend more than they want to, receive poor-value items or service, choose an inferior seller or platform, or spend less time or effort searching for alternatives. OCA practices can also cause a range of non-financial harms, including inducing unwanted data disclosures, privacy invasion, marketing advances, and habitual product usage OCA practices can weaken or distort competitive pressures. Where OCA practices distort consumer decision making, businesses may have less incentive to compete on product attributes that benefit the consumer, such as quality and price (Lindsey-Mullikin and Petty, 2011), and instead to compete on less beneficial attributes, such as prominence. Harmful OCA practices (which often require small tweaks to existing online environments) may often be easier and cheaper to implement than traditional innovation or research and development programmes. This can weaken competition on the merits of the products, and ultimately may result in poorer quality, more expensive products, less efficient markets and lower trust OCA practices can maintain, leverage or exploit market power. OCA may be particularly problematic where a business has market power because the business can use OCA to maintain, leverage or exploit their market position. For example, businesses with market power may use OCA practices to reduce the likelihood that those customers move outside of their ecosystem, or self-preference its own products to the detriment of other businesses on its platform Potential remedies This paper outlines various remedies, suggested by the academic research, to harms caused by OCA, or cases and analysis by consumer and competition authorities. This outline is meant to illustrate and provides a non-exhaustive list of examples as to how and when OCA harms could be addressed. This paper is not guidance as to how the CMA will act in future cases, and the appropriate remedy in each case will turn on its facts. There is a long list of carefully designed disclosures – price lists, information sheets, booklets, risk warnings – created by regulators and competition authorities that when applied in the real world were not read, heeded or acted upon by consumer, due to limited attention, context and constraints on time or cognitive capacity. For example, the Australian Securities and Investment Commission (ASIC) and the Netherlands Authority for Financial Markets (AFM) advocated that a focus on giving information or educating consumers to make better decisions is starting to be replaced by an understanding that changing choice architecture might be more effective. They also discuss that many information-based remedies tend to be less effective, in part due to behavioural biases, such as limited attention, inertia and overconfidence (ASIC and AFM, 2019). However, recent work on “boosting” (ie interventions aimed at improving people’s competences to make decisions in light of their own goals) showed some benefit (Hertwig and Grüne-Yanoff, 2021; Lorenz-Spreen et al., 2021). For example, Lorenz-Spreen et al. (2021) found that encouraging participants to think about their own personality traits boosted their ability (by up to 26 percentage points) to correctly identify microtargeted advertainment (ie a term used to reflect the intertwining relationships between advertising and entertainment) that was aimed at them. In addition to informing or educating consumers, authorities are increasingly calling for specific changes to the choice architecture in which people make decisions. This can include specifying the position, wording and design of important items, such as privacy settings, supplemented by real-life testing, to ensure options are sufficiently prominent (Competition and Markets Authority, 2020e). Sometimes this can be supported by in-depth behavioural design techniques, including user experience testing, eye tracking, and co-designing with users and choice architects (see for example, Adams et al., 2021). Care must be taken to ensure that businesses do not take actions to evade the intended effects of the choice architecture developed by regulators (Willis, 2013). Choice architecture practices often sit on a spectrum. While there is often no truly “neutral” presentation, choices can be made more or less prominent, desirable, or likely by manipulating their design (Gray, Chen et al., 2021). Where consumer preferences are not known and the stakes are high (for example, in infrequent major financial decisions) forcing consumers to make an active choice, without defaults, prompts or ordering options in a particular way might be the fairest design option. However, all choices exact a toll from consumers, and there are many cases where sensible defaults and ordered lists help to maximise consumer welfare (Smith et al., 2009). Addressing online choice architecture practices often means working out which direction on the spectrum a choice architect needs to move towards, for example how much friction is appropriate to introduce when designing a consumer journey. Taxonomy of OCA The field of “choice architecture” emerged when researchers started to unpack the cognitive peculiarities of human decision making. The wide focus on deviations in human decision making from the rational choice model, which underpins much of OCA, ranges from Simon’s bounded rationality proposal (Simon, 1955) and Tversky and Kahneman’s (1974) heuristics and biases program, to contemporary behavioural economics (Camerer et al., 2004), Thaler and Sunstein’s book on nudge (Thaler and Sunstein, 2008) or “applied behavioural science” (Kahneman, 2013). Previous attempts by academics to investigate the field of choice architecture practices have followed 2 main pathways (Münscher et al., 2016): the first focused on the underlying behavioural biases that could be the focus of any type of an intervention. For example, Datta and Mullainathan (2014) proposed that effective interventions should consider consumers’ self-control, attention, cognitive capacity, and comprehension, while Dolan et al. (2012) developed a framework that directs choice architects on how to use various psychological mechanisms, such as priming or prominence the second targeted specific choice architecture practices that may be considered when planning an intervention. For instance, Abrahamse et al. (2005) suggested focusing on facilitating commitment and providing feedback, while Johnson et al. (2012) recommended reducing the choice overload by removing options from the choice set, adjusting the time frames and sequences of choices, etc The taxonomy used in this paper was developed to help catalogue and differentiate various OCA practices, and to structure thinking about the relevant behavioural biases. Our taxonomy draws heavily on that of Münscher, Vetter and Scheuerle’s (2016), which focused on 3 main decision components: decision information; decision structure; and decision assistance. The proposed taxonomy incorporated elements of many other taxonomies and approaches, including: Brignull’s (2010) ad hoc taxonomy of dark patterns Gray et al.’s (2018) typology of dark patterns strategies Conti et al.’s (2010) taxonomy of malicious user interface designs Luguri and Strahilevitz’s (2021) taxonomy of dark patterns Mathur, Mayer and Kshirsagar’s (2021) descriptive approach towards categorising dark patterns Narayanan et al.’s (2020) illustration of dark patterns examples across disciplines Nguyen and McNealy’s (2021) “I, Obscura” – a dark pattern zine Robbins’ (2021) Taxonomy of Content Manipulation Shahab and Lades’ (2021) taxonomy of sludges Stango and Zinman’s (2021b) taxonomy of consumer decision making The taxonomy presented in this paper it is not intended to be used as a binding CMA tool for future cases. It serves as a logical outgrowth from the literature and is valuable for capturing facets of OCA for the purpose of this paper. It integrates elements of previous taxonomies (especially Münscher’s) into 3 main choice components: (i) information, (ii) structure, and (iii) pressure (see Figure 2). For the purpose of this taxonomy, the decision / choice component was renamed as “pressure” instead of “assistance” to highlight that some practices under certain conditions can have the potential to cause harm to consumers and businesses. Figure 2. The Choice Situation: (i) structure; (ii) information; (iii) and pressure – Proposed Taxonomy of Online Choice Architecture Figure 2 description: breaks down the choice situation into 3 main components: (i) Choice structure, (ii) Choice information and finally, (iii) Choice Pressure. Within the 3 OCA categories, the taxonomy of OCA practices synthesises the available literature, as shown in Table 1. The intention is that the taxonomy proposed in this paper will evolve over time to reflect developments in technology, business practices and research. It is also worth highlighting that harm may be aggravated where practices occur in combination (see section on Effectiveness of OCA practices). Table 1. Taxonomy of Online Choice Architecture categories and practices. Each description in the table below is intended to give a brief summary of the OCA practice. The CMA is not limited by these descriptions in assessing compliance with the law. 21 OCA Practices Choice Structure Category Description Strength of the Evidence (*) Defaults The choice architect applies a predefined setting that the consumer must take active steps to change 4 stars Ranking The choice architect displays the order of options in a particular way. 3 stars Partitioned pricing The choice architect presents individual price components without sharing the total or estimated total costs with the consumer. 3 stars Bundling The choice architect groups 2 or more products and/or services in a single “package” at a special price 3 stars Choice overload and decoys (**) The choice architect provides too many options to compare. 3 stars Choice overload and decoys (**) The choice architect adds an option to the choice set to make the other option(s) look more attractive to the consumer 3 stars Sensory manipulation(**) The choice architect employs visual, aural and tactile features to steer consumers towards certain options 3 stars Sludge(**) The choice architect creates excessive or unjustified friction that makes it difficult for consumers to get what they want or to do as they wish 3 stars Dark nudges (**) The choice architect makes it easy or removes friction for consumers to make inadvertent or ill-considered decisions 3 stars Virtual currency in gaming The choice architect creates elements of a virtual currency to be used as a substitute for the “real-world” currency 2 stars Forced outcomes (**) The choice architect changes the outcome without giving consumers a choice 2 stars Choice Information Category Description Strength of the Evidence (*) Drip pricing (**) The choice architect initially shows only part of the price and reveals the full price of the product or service at later stages of the consumer journey 4 stars Reference pricing The choice architect displays a previous (or future) price alongside the current price to make the current price look more attractive 4 stars Framing The choice architect decides how decision-relevant information is described or presented to a consumer 3 stars Complex language (**) The choice architect makes information difficult to understand by using obscure words and/or sentence structure 3 stars Information overload (**) The choice architect gives a consumer too much information about a product or service such that information about the most relevant attributes is difficult to find and assess 3 stars Choice Pressure Category Description Strength of the Evidence (*) Scarcity and popularity claims The choice architect informs consumers about limited stock, limited time to buy or high popularity of an item 3 stars Prompts and reminders The choice architect contacts the consumer to induce an action and/or follow up on a previous interaction 2 stars Messengers The choice architect provides a platform on which a specific person or group can communicate with consumers 2 stars Commitment The choice architect facilitates commitment by consumers to a particular behaviour in the future 2 stars Feedback The choice architect provides consumers with feedback 2 stars Personalisation The choice architect uses data to personalise offers 2 stars (*) The evidence measure is taken from Ruggeri, Linden, Wang, Papa, Afif, Riesch and Green’s (2020) table of evidence standards, also known as THEARI (Theoretical Empirical Applicable Replicable and Impact) rating system. These standards are intended to communicate the strength of empirical evidence to policymakers: 1-star evidence rating (Theoretical) means that a concept has been discussed but lacks empirical validation; 2-star evidence rating (Empirical) means that a concept has been validated but lacks more robust data; 3-star evidence rating (Applicable) means that results are taken from controlled, reasonably powered trials; 4-star evidence rating (Replicable) means that the results have been successfully replicated in terms of setting, procedure and measurement; 5-star evidence rating (Impact) means that result insights have been implemented and applied at scale. (**) This practice is usually (or almost always) considered harmful, according to the existing academic literature reviewed in this paper. It is important to note, however, that not all practices listed above are necessarily harmful by nature; some can have a positive or negative effect, depending on the conditions under and the context in which they are used. Additionally, those not suggested as usually or always harmful may be problematic in any particular case. Effectiveness of OCA practices In real online markets, many of the OCA practices would not appear in isolation and, when used in combination, it can be hard to distinguish the effects of individual practices on consumers’ decisions. For example, free trials can obviously be beneficial to consumers, especially for experience goods, where product characteristics, such as quality or price, are difficult to observe in advance, but these characteristics can be ascertained upon consumption. But free trials – those that could lead to subscription traps – also involve a combination of multiple OCA practices. To create them, the choice architect would likely have had to set up a particular default, use elements of partitioned and drip pricing, reference pricing, friction and sometimes elements of other practices (for example, framing, decoy pricing if consumers look at the subscription options) with personalisation (for example, using outbound marketing notifications or emails to increase the number of consumers signing up). There have been several systematic reviews on the effectiveness of selected choice architecture interventions in specific areas, such as food, pro-environmental behaviour, lifestyle risk factors and physical activity (for example, Byerly et al., 2018; Carter et al., 2018; Wright and Bragge, 2018; for full description, see Annex, Table 8 with an overview of studies). However, most research investigates practices in isolation because investigating combined effects can be more complex and costly. For example, Szaszi et al. (2018) gave a systematic review of the choice architecture intervention across various domains, such as consumer choice, health, sustainability, education, transport, finance, health, and others. To categorise the intervention, Szaszi et al. used the classification suggested by Münscher et al. (2016) (see Taxonomy of OCA). Specifically, Szaszi et al. (2018) found that 74% of the studies mainly assessed the effectiveness of interventions in one specific setting, while 24% of the studies focused on the exploration of moderator variables or underlying processes. This type of analysis shows that it may be useful to further explore the impact of combined OCA practices. In addition, a recent quantitative review by Mertens et al. (2022) analysed the effectiveness of interventions across different choice architecture practices (referring to Münscher’s taxonomy, 2016), behavioural domains, populations and locations. They showed that choice architecture interventions generally reach a small to medium effect size (ie an effect size is a way to quantify difference between 2 or more groups by using, for an example as in this study, a standardised mean difference also known as Cohen’s d), and that effectiveness substantially differs as a function of practice and domain. This means that if the Cohen’s d value is higher, there is a larger difference between the average individual in each group. In general, a d value of 0.2 or smaller is considered to be a small effect size; a d value of around 0.5 is considered to be a medium effect size; and a d value of 0.8 or larger is considered to be a large effect size. Figure 3. Forest plot of effect sizes across categories of choice architecture intervention techniques (source: Mertens, Herberz, Hahnel and Brosch, 2022) Figure 3 description: is a forest plot from Mertens et al. (2022) summarising the effect sizes of choice architecture interventions. The right-hand side of the figure represents the individual Cohen d estimates and the corresponding range confidence interval given in the table on the left-hand side of the figure. More specifically, comparing the effectiveness of decision information (“choice information” in the proposed taxonomy), decision structure (“choice structure” in the proposed taxonomy), and decision assistance (“choice pressure” in the proposed taxonomy) interventions across different domains consistently demonstrated that interventions within the “choice structure” category had the largest effect on behaviour (see Figure 3). For example, using defaults in designing an intervention had medium to large effects (d=0.62) on consumer behaviour than providing access to relevant information (d=0.36) or encouraging consumers to self-commit (d=0.30). The authors explained that the relative advantage of structural OCA practices was due to consumers not needing to as much effort when processing information. Furthermore, Vasas (2021) synthesised the available evidence on the effectiveness of nudge interventions that targeted search and switching behaviour in retail financial markets. The results showed that choice structure-based interventions have stronger effect on search and switching behaviour than on the choice information-based interventions (for example, simplifying or highlighting information). Overall, nudge interventions increase consumer search and switching behaviour by 2-3 percentage points on average across reported studies. On the other hand, DellaVigna and Linos (2022) compared the effect size of nudge interventions by 2 of the largest Nudge Units (ie governmental and non-governmental organisations applying behavioural insights to enhance consumer welfare) in the USA against the effect size of trials published in academic journals. The authors observed that the average impact of a nudge conducted by Nudge Units is smaller than the average impact of trials published in academic journals. The authors concluded that selective publication or publication bias in academic journals and differences in trial features, such as in-person communication vs. letter-based communication, can largely account for the difference in observed effect sizes. As mentioned above, there is limited research on how the combined effects of each practice may be effective in influencing consumers, but Luguri and Strahilevitz (2021) provided some empirical evidence on how consumers might react when exposed to a combination of OCA practices in the “bait and switch” scenario (for example, a type of dark pattern where consumers plan to do one thing, but a different, unwanted thing happens instead). They have conducted a study by asking adult US participants to express their initial attitudes towards privacy. Depending on the level of interest in privacy, participants were assigned into different experimental groups. For example, participants who expressed strong interest in privacy were defaulted into a costly identity theft protection service where they have been led to believe that they would need to pay for the service with their own money unless they opted out. Then, the study authors randomly varied whether the opportunity to opt-out was influenced by different types of OCA practices. In their experiment, some participants were initially asked to either click “Accept and continue (recommended)” or “Other options,” and the button that accepted the program was selected by default. If participants chose “Other options”, they were shown the next screen and asked to choose between “I do not want to protect my data or credit history” and “After reviewing my options, I would like to protect my privacy and receive data protection and credit history monitoring” (for example, framing). Next, if participants did not accept the program, they were asked to explain why they declined the valuable protection. Several non-compelling or unappealing options were listed, including “My credit rating is already bad”, “Even though 16.7 million Americans were victimized by identity theft last year, I do not believe it could happen to me or my family”, “I’m already paying for identity theft and credit monitoring services”, and “I’ve got nothing to hide so if hackers gain access to my data I won’t be harmed”. This is another example of manipulating the option consequences and framing (also known as “confirmshaming”). Participants could also choose “Other” and type in their reason, or choose “On second thoughts, please sign me up for 6 months of free credit history monitoring and data protection services”. Participants attempting to decline the identity theft protection were then told that since they indicated they did not want to protect their data, they would receive more information so that they could make an informed choice, which included “emotionally charged framing”. They were forced to remain on the page for at least 10 seconds before being able to advance, and they were shown a countdown timer during this period, adding further friction in their decision journey through the use of sludge (also known as “roach motel”). If participants went through all 3 information screens and chose “I would like to read more information”, they were then directed to a question designed to deliberately confuse them. They were asked, “If you decline this free service, our corporate partner won’t be able to help you protect your data. You will not receive identity theft protection, and you could become one of the millions of Americans who were victimized by identity theft last year. Are you sure you want to decline this free identity theft protection?” The 2 options were “No, cancel” and “Yes”. This question was intentionally framed to confuse participants about which option they should select to decline the program (Luguri and Strahilevitz, 2021). When participants were exposed to this aggressive dark pattern condition, their rate of acceptance (41.9%) quadrupled, with a 371% increase in rates of acceptance compared to the control group condition (11.3%). Luguri and Strahilevitz’s (2021) study showed that combined OCA (framing and defaults, sludge, and forcing unwanted outcomes) were more effective than mild and control group conditions in the study (Luguri and Strahilevitz, 2021). Based on this study and real-world examples, where OCA practices rarely appear in isolation, it is likely that the effectiveness of OCA practices might be stronger when combined. For example, personalisation may make dark patterns more effective and harder to detect (for example, if businesses can tailor the most effective practices for different consumer groups). Prevalence of OCA practices Online environments have created new and convenient opportunities to implement and test the impact of choice architecture practices. This section presents the existing work aimed at investigating the prevalence of OCA. More specifically, it presents: academic work on prevalence of OCA practices, including the intersection of OCA and markets work by consumer and competition authorities and consumer organisations Academic work on prevalence, including the intersection of OCA and markets Mathur et al. (2019) developed a semi-automated method for crawling more than 11,000 popular shopping websites to measure the prevalence of dark patterns. They found dark patterns on more than 11% of those sites (for example, 1,818 examples of different OCA practices identified on 1,254 of the 11,286 e-commerce websites). One of the limitations of the study was that their method looked only for text-based elements that could be captured in a web crawl and did not include visual-based elements (for example, positioning of text, size of the font, colour). This means that the analysis likely underestimates the presence of OCA practices. In addition, Mathur et al. (2019) developed a descriptive taxonomy of dark pattern characteristics that captures the following 5 dimensions: Asymmetric Ie overemphasising the features of one choice, while not displaying equally prominently other choices, such as visually manipulating the colour of one option. Covert Ie steering the consumer to make specific decisions without them being aware of the manipulation, such as introducing a decoy option to make certain other options appear more appealing. Deceptive Ie inducing false beliefs about the interface, such as fake countdown timers. Hiding Ie not disclosing all the relevant information, such as drip pricing. Restrictive Ie not allowing consumers to freely navigate through the interface, such as forced action. Most of the OCA practices detected in the paper were covert, deceptive and hiding important information from consumers (Mathur et al., 2019). In a subsequent paper, Mathur et al. (2021) proposed an additional attribute to their taxonomy: Disparate treatment Ie allowing consumers with more resources to have a more favourable treatment, such as skipping interfaces while gaming. Di Geronimo et al. (2020) analysed Google Play Store apps (for example, Facebook, Amazon, Twitter) within the first 10 minutes of their usage. They demonstrated that potentially harmful OCA were widely prevalent across different apps. On average, each app used 7 OCA practices. The distribution of OCA practices can be seen from Figure 4 below, with ranking (ie false hierarchy – 61%), defaults (ie pre-selection – 60%), prompts and reminders (ie nagging – 55%), sludge (ie roach motel – 41%) and forcing outcomes (ie forcing action – 38%), leading the way. The follow-up experiment also found that most participants did not identify OCA practices when exposed to them, but were able to perform better in recognising them if they were informed what to look for (di Geronimo et al., 2020). Figure 4. Percentage of apps containing each subcategory of harmful OCA (source: di Geronimo et al., 2020) Figure 4 description: is a bar chart taken from di Geronimo et al. (2020) depicting the percentage of apps containing each subcategory of harmful OCA practices. The main categories are Obstruction, Sneaking, Interface Interference and Forced Action. The practice of Nagging (55%) stands uncategorised whereas, Roach motel (41%), Price comparison prevention (10%) and Intermediate currency (10%) falls under Obstruction. Sneak into Basket (1%), Bait and Switch (16%), Hidden Information (31%) and Preselection (60) are categorised under Sneaking. Aesthetic manipulation (33%), Toying with Emotion (9%), False hierarchy (61%), Disguised Ad (33%) and Trick Questions (0%) are subcategories of Interface Interference. Finally, Forced Action (38%), Privacy Zuckering (31%) and Social Pyramid (6%) are classified under Forced Action. Moser et al. (2019) completed a systematic review of the top 200 e-commerce websites in the USA. Their content analysis showed that 75% of websites had at least one OCA practice that could encourage impulse buying. While truthful scarcity claims can be informative in some instances, the authors found that a common element of those websites (featured in almost 95% cases) was relying on social pressure, such as providing recommendations on what others bought or low stock warnings (17%). These are examples of supply and demand types of scarcity claims. Meyer et al. (2019) described the advertising content across 135 children’s apps, and found that 95% of the apps contained at least one type of problematic advertising. These features ranged from the use of characters from popular cartoons and toy franchises (48%), prompts to upgrade to the full version of the app (46%), advertising videos that suddenly interrupt play or appear at the start/finish of different levels (35%), in-app purchases that enable gamers to buy extra credits, accessories and items that make the gameplay smoother (30%), and other advertising features. Gunawan et al.’s (2021) comparative study of mobile application, mobile browser, and web browser versions of 105 popular services investigated variations in dark patterns across modalities. They found that while services can employ some dark patterns equally across modalities, many dark patterns vary between platforms (see Table 2 below), and that these differences saddle people with inconsistent experiences of autonomy, privacy, and control. For example, the most prevalent dark patterns across all 3 modalities (67-70%) was no consent checkbox for the Terms of Service/Privacy Policy, while mobile apps (62%) were much more likely to have notification setting opt-in by default in contrast to desktop and mobile website (45-50%) (Gunawan et al., 2021). Table 2. Top 10 dark patterns sorted by percentage of websites or apps containing the pattern (source: Gunawan et al., 2021) Top 10 dark patterns Desktop websites (%) Mobile websites (%) Mobile apps (%) No consent checkbox for ToS/PP 70 70 67 No account deletion 52 57 67 No privacy settings 52 55 66 Notification setting opt-in by default 45 50 62 Visual option precedence 41 39 48 No bulk options for settings 32 37 47 General pop-up nags 31 34 44 Privacy setting opt-in by default 30 30 39 Extraneous notification badges 26 27 32 Account required 25 27 30 The following 4 academic studies have explored the use of potentially harmful OCA in the domain of consent notices: Utz et al. (2019) selected a random sample of 1,000 consent notices relating to the 500 most popular European Union (EU) websites. They showed that 57.4% of consent notices used some element of visual manipulation practice. For example, the websites often used distinctive colour to draw attention to the button to accept privacy-unfriendly defaults, pre-selected checkboxes that enable consumer data collection, as well as masking advanced settings behind difficult-to-spot links Nouwens et al. (2020) analysed privacy consent notices across the top 10,000 UK websites. They found that websites preferred to use notice designs that were more implicit (32.5%). In most of the notices, consumers had to put significantly more effort into rejecting their data tracking, which was a combination of a sludge and visual manipulation, where approximately 50% of websites were missing a “reject all” button completely Matte et al. (2020) conducted a semi-automatic crawl of consent notices across 560 websites. They showed that defaults were predominantly used (46.5%) by pre-selecting privacy-unfriendly options for consumers Soe et al. (2020) explored consent notices in the context of news outlets to check their compliance with General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). They found that almost all websites used OCA in a harmful way when eliciting consent from consumers. Specifically, they showed that to deny consent directly or via browser settings, only 15 of the 300 websites provided a direct 1-click deny button, in contrast to all of them having 1-click accept button (ie dark nudge). In addition, approximately 50% of the websites required 10-12 clicks to click on deny consent button (ie sludge) Work by consumer and competition authorities and consumer organisations The recent Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) report on “Dark commercial patterns online” (2021) suggested that prevalence of harmful OCA is high – including across e-commerce websites, apps, privacy consent notices and others. However, researchers and investigators do not often have access to internal data of businesses that might provide information on the relative effectiveness of different practices, nor the ways in which they are deployed. Instead, academics and consumer and competition authorities have collected data using different techniques to identify OCA practices “in the wild”, including: web-scraping techniques (ie automatically search websites and extract data on OCA practices) web-sweeping techniques in collaboration with other international regulators or authorities (ie manually checking on websites to identify potential examples of harmful OCA) mystery shopping (ie mirroring the “actual/real” consumer experience of buying a product or a service) requests for information (ie either “informally” or by using powers to request businesses to provide documents and information). The International Consumer Protection and Enforcement Network (OECD, 2021) conducted a sweep of 1,300 e-commerce websites/apps across different of sectors and found that over one-fifth of them appeared to involve one or more examples of harmful OCA practices. The 3 most identified OCA practices were defaults (for example pre-ticked boxes), scarcity claims and drip pricing. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, 2021) analysed consumer reviews of the top 1,000 grossing and “free” apps on the Apple App Store and Google Play Store. The term “subscription” was strongly linked to the negative reviews on both stores because consumers usually would have a hard time understanding that they were agreeing to a subscription, or the price of the subscription, and/or struggling to cancel (ie sludge). The Chilean consumer authority (El Servicio Nacional del Consumidor; SERNAC) found that 64% of the businesses they observed used some type of potentially harmful OCA to make people buy or do things they do not want, such as registering and handing over their data (ICPEN, 2021). For this study, SERNAC analysed 107 websites of businesses, looking for practices that are hard to spot for consumers, such as sludge, drip pricing, false scarcity and others (ICPEN, 2021). The Norwegian Consumer Council, Forbrukerrådet (2018, 2021), conducted 3 related analyses on data-privacy practices across well-known digital platforms (for example Facebook, Google, Windows, Amazon) using mystery shopping: in the first study, Forbrukerrådet (2018) analysed a sample of privacy-related settings in Facebook, Google and Windows. All 3 were found to use a range of OCA practices in a harmful way. For instance, Facebook and Google used privacy-unfriendly defaults that made it easy for consumers to agree to share their data, but made it substantially harder for consumers to deny them access in the second study, Forbrukerrådet’s (2018) analysis focused on Google and its location tracking practices. They discovered the use of various OCA practices, including: enabling location tracking by default hiding relevant information (ie visual manipulation) making it easier to agree to tracking via click-flow feature on their mobile devices (ie dark nudges) making it harder to deny tracking (ie sludge) in the third study, Forbrukerrådet (2021) ran a similar analysis of Amazon and its Prime Services. They found asymmetry in the consumer journey because consumers were able to easily sign up for the Prime Service, but experienced multiple obstacles to cancel it. These included visual manipulation and greater effort to navigate through several screens (ie sludge). Choice Structure The way options or choices are structured and presented can affect consumers’ behaviour and decisions. For example, imagine you are buying a subscription to your favourite video game. Even before you have started to explore the options at your preferred provider, the choice architect has structured options in such a way that it will guide your decisions – you can’t choose an option that doesn’t exist (an example of forced outcomes). Perhaps you are shown a set of options, but one stands out; perhaps it is pre-selected, has a big red circle around it and is shown in the middle of the options. This is an example of a default, where the choice architect has already predefined an option and used sensory manipulation to make that choice more prominent through colour, size and positioning. In the most egregious cases, a provider may add the subscription to your shopping basket without you taking any action (this is a dark pattern called “sneak into basket”). Perhaps, before you decide to subscribe, you visit a comparison website that lets you see a wide range of options. The way the options are presented – whether in a list (ie one after another), simultaneously, or as a part of a scorecard/table – will affect what you would pick and how you would feel about your choice (Basu and Savani, 2017; Mogilner et al., 2013). In addition, if there are too many options, this might induce choice overload (Iyengar and Lepper, 2000). Knowing that consumers rarely look beyond the top results (Agarwal, Hosanagar, et al., 2011), the choice architect might consider how to fill those top spots. Should they rank the options by customer rating, relevance, price, how much the business has paid the comparison website, or by something else? Will this ranking be aligned with your preferences (ie ethical choice architecture)? How easy should it be for you to change the criteria for ranking, and will you actually do it? Do you even know which criteria you should use to sort the items by, or would you be guided by the criteria set by the business offering the product? In most cases, preferences are “formed on the spot”; consumers do not know beforehand what they are looking for (Slovic, 1995). Thus, the structure of choice per se could define and form your preferences. You manage to compare different options and decide which subscription deal seems the best. At the final screen, you see that price has been separated and displayed into multiple charges, and it might take you some time to realise what exactly you need to pay for and what might be optional (this is an example of partitioned pricing). Once you have bought your subscription, you realise that the rules have changed. In the world of the game, you might have to buy virtual currency, which may make it harder for you to value in-game options. In the middle of the level, you are prompted with an in-app purchase advert for the new powerful weapon that will enable you to progress through the game more easily. The button to make that purchase is just one-click away (ie a dark nudge). Perhaps you decide to cancel your subscription. How easy is it to do this? You were able to sign up at the click of a button – but perhaps, to cancel, you must make a phone call during office hours, armed with reference numbers. This is an example of sludge – excessive friction that prevents you from acting in your own interests. Choice architects often have a good understanding of these techniques and the impact they can have on consumers. In many cases, they may have varied choice structures over time and extensively tested consumer responses to the variations. In other cases, choice architects can reproduce techniques widespread techniques, without fully knowing the full effect they will have on consumer behaviour. Existing behavioural literature shows that consumers often do not rationally compare attributes or alternatives and find the “best” option for themselves. As noted above, consumers do not always know what they are looking for. Their preferences can be “formed and constructed on the spot” (Slovic, 1995). So, the structure of choice can define which attributes people will compare options on. Thus, the way choice is presented affects the formation of the preferences of the consumers. Second, even if consumers have well-established preferences and know what they want to buy, maximising strategies (ie comparing all possible alternatives on all attributes) are often shown to be hard to apply or are unsuitably adapted (Schwartz et al., 2002). However, some alternative strategies have been suggested, such as satisficing (ie settling on a choice that is merely acceptable, rather than optimal) (Payne et al., 1988). Accordingly, choice architects can control the arrangement of options and the decision-making format, which includes setting defaults, rearranging the composition of options, and changing option-related efforts, medium or consequences, thereby affecting consumers’ behaviour and decisions.

Defaults Defaults apply a predefined setting that users are less likely to change; setting defaults is one of the most effective online choice architecture practices (Jachimowicz et al., 2019; Smith et al., 2013). From a range of settings, here is strong evidence that shows that changing or setting defaults is more effective at influencing consumer choices and behaviours than changing the information (for example, simplification) (Levin et al., 1998; Mertens et al., 2022). Looking at defaults from the perspective of consumer welfare, consumer autonomy and ethics, researchers have argued that ignoring defaults is not an option for regulators (Smith et al., 2009). In the early days of online selling, defaults, in the form of pre-ticked boxes, became very prevalent (Jabłonowska and Michałowicz, 2020). For example, travel insurance was sometimes sold automatically when consumers were purchasing flight tickets, and cancellation insurance was automatically included in the sale of event tickets. In 2019, The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) ruled that websites need active consent to store cookies on users’ devices. In particular, the CJEU ruled that a pre-ticked check box that users must de-select is not a valid form of consent (Federal Court of Justice, Germany vs. Planet49 GmbH In Case C-673/17, 2019). However, the use of potentially harmful defaults may still be prevalent in a variety of settings (for example, online search, social media services) and different features of online consumer journeys. While a default in general might help users to make better choices by pre-selection of the most beneficial options, defaults are not always designed with the consumer’s best interests in mind (Konsumentverket, 2021). For example, Google Ads Networks enabled advertisers to broaden their search advertising campaigns beyond Google-owned and -operated properties. Within the Google Ads networks display, “Include Google search partners” and “Include Google Display Network” were automatically pre-selected, as seen in Figure 5. In the final report of CMA’s Market Study on Online platforms and digital advertising (Competition and Markets Authority, 2020f), there was concern that Google was leveraging its strong market position from search into display by swaying advertisers to keep this option selected. Figure 5. Google Ads networks default settings (Source: Competition and Markets Authority, 2020f Screenshot taken 08/04/2020, Google Ads.) Figure 5 description: is a screenshot taken from CMA (2020f) capturing Google Ads networks default settings where the option to “Include Google search partners” and “Include Google Display Network” are preselected by default. Effect on consumers and businesses There is wide-ranging evidence from nudge units (ie governmental and non- governmental organisations applying behavioural insights to enhance consumer welfare) and other practitioners that defaults are more effective than other behavioural measures (for example, transparency). DellaVigna and Linos (2022) removed default interventions from their meta-analysis of nudges because large effects skewed the overall results, and because nudge units rarely change the default owing to institutional constraints that are difficult to implement (especially in the USA). They defined default interventions as interventions that “change which outcome happens automatically if an individual remains passive” (Bronchetti et al., 2013), as in the classical case of retirement savings defaults. Defaults exhibit stronger effects in the presence of many alternatives than in only 2-alternative choices (Cronqvist and Thaler, 2004; Park et al., 2000; Shafir et al., 1993). For example, an analysis of many pension options chosen by Swedish consumers (Cronqvist and Thaler, 2004) showed that one-third of them ended up with their entire investment in the default fund, despite an elaborate educational campaign nudging them to make active choices. These findings illustrate how a large potential number of options can make consumers remain with the given default. Beshears et al. (2010) showed that the defaults become less effective when they are set as more extreme options. In this study, only one-quarter of employees stayed automatically enrolled at the 12% contribution rates for retirement savings plan, which was viewed as significantly higher than in other studies and suboptimal for all the employees. In addition, the results showed that those employees who did not change their default position were in the low-income category, meaning those individuals were disproportionally worse off. Jachimowicz, Duncan, Webber and Johnson (2019) carried out a meta-analysis of 58 studies to understand whether default effects have an impact on consumers and, if so, how big it was. They found that a pre-selected default option is, on average, 27% more likely to be selected in a two-option choice. Even when attempting to correct for factors that could potentially bias this estimate (ie publication bias), they find that, if anything, the default effect increases. This indicates that studies that identified large default effects were being underreported in the published literature. Although the default effect is on average large, there is significant variation in the size of this effect. This might be partly explained by some of the study characteristics: in particular, defaults that affect decisions on consumer goods tend to be more effective than defaults that involve environmental decisions. They tested other study characteristics, such as whether the study was a field or a lab experiment, whether it was conducted in the USA or somewhere else, by time of publication, by type of choice (ie whether it is binary or continuous), but found that these other characteristics do not explain variation in the default effect size. Jachimowicz et al. (2019) speculated that this might be because consumer preferences that affect the environment are more strongly held than preferences on consumer goods or services. Furthermore, Jachimowicz et al. (2019) identified few psychological mechanisms, including effort, implied endorsement, endowment, status quo and reference dependence. choosing the default option minimises consumers’ effort when making a decision (Johnson and Goldstein, 2003). The literature has identified 2 types of effort that are relevant: physical and mental effort. Physical effort can involve whatever action is necessary for the consumer to take to change the default. While part of the older literature considers actions, such as filling in paper forms or collecting necessary documentations, these are likely to be less relevant in the digital environment, where physical actions are likely to be less cumbersome. However, it is worth noting that consumer expectations are changing in line with the technological advances (Bhattacherjee and Premkumar, 2004). For example, consumers might find having to search online for information or fill in online forms equally as cumbersome as posting a letter in the past. In fact, sometimes cumbersome offline efforts are also required to change an online default (for example, having to telephone to cancel a subscription) – see section on Sludge. Mental effort is the neurocognitive effort required for an individual to make a decision. It involves mental calculations aimed at identifying trade-offs and the best option, which takes time and increases consumers’ cognitive efforts (Johnson and Goldstein, 2003) another explanation – implied endorsement – suggests that defaults are effective because consumers may perceive that the intentions of the choice architect (for example, the business whose website the consumer is using to make a purchase), in the form of the pre-selected options, are recommendations for their own benefit (Jachimowicz et al., 2019; McKenzie et al., 2006; Sunstein and Thaler, 2003). This may be because consumers believe that the choice architect wants them to select the default option (direct implied endorsement) or because consumers choose the default on the basis that this is what most people would do (external implied endorsement). In an online shopping context, Brown and Krishna (2004) argued that consumers may treat the defaults set by businesses as a recommendation and, in the case of less-reputable businesses, as a clear signal to their choices are being influenced defaults may also lead consumers to act as if they have already chosen the default option (endowment effect) and, consequently, they use the default as a reference point to construct their preferences (reference dependence). These biases can also be explained in terms of loss aversion (ie tendency to dislike losses more than they like equivalent gains). Thaler, Kahneman, and Knetsch (1991) argued that consumers may perceive that they already own the default option and getting rid of it might be viewed as a potential loss. First, the endowment effect may lead consumers to value what they perceive as being already theirs (the pre-selected default) more highly and therefore be averse to the idea of losing it (Park et al., 2000). Second, for status quo bias, any deviation from the current baseline might be perceived as a loss (Ritov and Baron, 1990). Third, consumers may use the default option as a reference point against which they construct their preferences, leading to a change in their evaluation of other options. This is because when exercising a choice, consumers construct and evaluate their preferences by retrieving information from their memory about the options available. In doing so, the content and order in which this information is retrieved and assessed (such as reasons for and against owning a particular object) may have an impact on what is preferred and ultimately chosen. The existence of a default option may increase and pre-empt the retrieval of information in favour of that option, leading to the default effect. Dinner et al. (2011) suggested that this may be induced by the so-called Query Theory (ie a memory-based view). They argued that when individuals decide, (a) they identify different arguments in the process by making unique queries, such as generating reasons for or against owning a particular object; and (b) they perform these queries sequentially In their experiments, Dinner et al. (2011) found that reference dependence and preference construction can play a primary role in the default effect. However, they stress that this is unlikely to be the only mechanism able to explain the default effect across all the situations in which this has been found. Instead, it is probable that effort, implied endorsement and reference dependence likely play a role in different situations, with the strength of each mechanism varying depending on the circumstances. Graßl and his collaborators (2021) conducted a behavioural experiment to investigate the effects of 3 OCA practices – “defaults”, “visual manipulation”, and “hard to cancel sludge” – on consumers’ decisions in cookie consent requests and their perception of control over their personal data. They showed that most participants in the study agreed to all consent requests regardless of the dark patterns, meaning that there was no substantial effect of the dark patterns on consumers’ consent decision relative to a no-dark patterns scenario. As a potential explanation for this outcome, the authors argued that encountering consent request daily has led consumers to develop a rule of thumb on how to deal with privacy settings. Interestingly enough, the presence of those 3 practices did not make participants perceive less control over their personal data – instead, obstructing the privacy-friendly option “Do not Agree” by changing into “Manage options” actually led to more, rather than less, perceived control. In another follow-up experiment by Graßl et al. (2021), all of the 3 practices – default, visual manipulation, and sludge – were designed to influence participants in favour of the privacy-friendly option. This time the results showed that sludge and defaults steered participants about 10 times more towards choosing the privacy-unfriendly option than to the first study outlined above. Harm to Consumers and Competition In some cases, defaults are so well hidden that consumers may not be aware they even have a choice (Smith et al., 2009). For example, many consumers do not change the default browser setting on their screens and if large numbers of consumers stick with the default, it can have a large economic impact on web browser dominance. The Mobile Ecosystems Market Study Interim report (Competition and Markets Authority, 2021c) described how default settings and pre-installations play an important role in consumers’ choice of browser. This is because the process for setting up a new default browser on both iOS and Android devices involves a series of potentially difficult steps, such as installing a new preferred default browser and navigating to find the relevant options. An important consequence of this market power in search is that it creates conditions make it difficult for rivals to compete on an equal footing. This was considered to be exacerbated by Google’s behaviour that makes it more difficult for rivals to compete, which can reduce the ability and incentive for rivals to innovate (Competition and Markets Authority, 2020a). Another type of default is automatic renewal, a practice whereby businesses unilaterally renew consumers’ subscriptions when they expire, unless consumers actively cancel by a certain date (Konsumentverket, 2021). Obviously automatic renewal can be a very useful practice and prevent customers having to pay active attention to renewing a subscription and it can also make sure that customers are not without a product, if they fail to renew in time. But automatic renewal may also take advantage of consumers’ failure to check up on expiry dates for services, either for a free trial or for a limited time use of a paid service. By using this practice, businesses might assume incorrectly that consumers want to continue the paid service or upgrade to the paid version of the free trial, without actively checking with the consumer. Over the years, unfair or deceptive “negative option practices” such as these have remained a persistent source of consumer harm, often saddling shoppers with recurring payments for products and services they did not intend to buy or did not want to continue buying (Federal Trade Commission, 2021). The CMA has also been active in this area – including responding to the loyalty penalty super complaint, anti-virus software enforcement, cloud storage, online dating, and a range of European and global co-ordinated actions and projects (BEIS, 2021; Competition and Markets Authority, 2018b, 2018c). Defaults can cause harm in high-stakes decisions also and even when people are aware they are being influenced. For instance, Loewenstein et al. (2015) revealed to the participants that they were about to be defaulted to a random choice about their future medical wishes and allowed them to revise their choices – yet they still chose the default more frequently. Literature on potential remedies Active choice is one potential remedy used to counteract harmful defaults, particularly where it is difficult to decide on an alternative default that is more likely to be in consumers’ interests. This type of remedy places special emphasis on consumer autonomy (Smith et al., 2009). Common examples include “choice screens,” which force consumers to choose a default setting from a list before continuing. For example, as discussed in the Discussion paper, following the European Commission’s 2018 finding (under appeal) in its Android case, Google introduced a choice screen on all new Android phones and tablets in the European Economic Area, including the UK, allowing users to select a search engine default (CASE AT.40099 Google Android, 2018). As noted in the CMA’s Mobile Ecosystems market study interim report, there may be limits on the impact of choice screens on the search engine used by consumers (Competition and Markets Authority, 2021e). For example, in the year to 31 August 2021 in the UK, almost all users chose Google Search in instances where they saw the choice screen Google introduced. To note, Google have introduced an updated choice screen, as of 1 September 2021. Choice screens have also been recommended for other contexts but with caveats on the need for testing and trialling with consumers. For example, in the CMA’s Online Platforms and Digital Advertising Market Study, the CMA recommended requiring platforms to give consumers the choice not to share their data for personalised advertising (the “choice requirement remedy”) (Competition and Markets Authority, 2020c). The CMA also proposed that the Digital Markets Unit (DMU) should be empowered to require Google and Facebook to observe a “Fairness by Design” duty to design choice architecture in a way that encourages free and informed decision making by consumers. This was intended to enhance user awareness and control over data. The CMA also recommended testing and trialling choice screens with consumers before implementation (Competition and Markets Authority, 2020c). A temporarily successful active choice experiment was the Swedish government’s extensive information campaign to encourage citizens to choose between 456 mutual funds for their pension rather than rely on a default option: two-thirds of citizens did so in 2000 (Cronqvist et al., 2018). However, once the campaign finished, the default once again became predominant, with less than 1% making an active choice of fund by 2003. This example showed that effective information campaigns can encourage consumers to consider changing their defaults, but also underscores that campaigns must be continuous to retain the effect. Active choice may be less well suited to decisions with many alternatives, where consumers have less well-formed preferences or where something must happen if the consumer fails to make an active choice (Beshears et al., 2021; Carroll et al., 2009). It may also require considerable effort from consumers, and this cost should be factored into the trade-off for whether to use a default versus active choice. In fact, in many contexts, defaults are both unavoidable and potentially welfare enhancing. For example, Smith et al. (2009) set out 3 types of defaults that can be set by businesses: Benign defaults refer to the situation where the default is set from the preferences of most of the consumers when faced with making an active choice. This means that the greatest number of consumers can benefit. For example, in the case of pension savings, a majority of workers acknowledge that it would be beneficial to have sufficient income in retirement but struggle to make that daily choice. Therefore, setting a new default so that workers allocate a portion of future salary increases towards their retirement savings made a significant change (Thaler and Benartzi, 2004). However, administering such policies might be quite difficult, the choices might not suit some consumers, and it could be a problem if the consequences are large or significant for those who are not in the majority (Smith et al., 2009) Smart defaults refer to the situation where the default is purposely designed to help specific groups of consumers make better decisions. For example, a smart default for pension savings could be based on a simple linear model incorporating consumers’ age, family status, intended age of retirement, risk preferences, loss aversion, and others. The key challenge for smart defaults is to collect enough consumer-specific data sufficiently quickly to compute the default calculation (Smith et al., 2009) Adaptive defaults refer to the situation where the setting of the default is based on the consumers’ previous choices. For example, an adaptive default would require businesses to present the options with defaults that represent the best guess of what might be chosen, conditional on what has been chosen to date. This type of default might be particularly relevant in the online shopping environment where businesses can keep track of past consumer shopping decisions. However, if bias drove the initial purchases, this bias would quickly be built into the system and its effects multiplied (Smith et al., 2009) In some instances, it might be suitable to require procedural constraints to reduce the prospect of consumers rejecting a welfare-enhancing default (Smith et al., 2009). These constraints usually raise the cost of moving away from the default by requiring greater effort. For example, software businesses might label settings as “recommended” when installing software to deter users from changing to less suitable settings. In other instances, where the default is not welfare enhancing for at least some consumers, warnings and disclosures may be warranted (Robinson et al., 2016). When it comes to the use of defaults (for example, where auto-renewal of a subscription is set as the default option) that could lead to consumer harm, concerns may arise about the business’s compliance with consumer protection law. In these circumstances, remedies might be achieved through enforcement action. For example, the CMA launched an investigation into 2 leading anti-virus software businesses, McAfee and Norton, which related to their practices and terms associated with the automatic renewal of one-year product subscriptions for a further year (Competition and Markets Authority, 2018c). A feature of these businesses (respective) subscriptions is that automatic renewal is typically set as the default option. The CMA was concerned that this could play a role in some customers carrying on paying for annual subscriptions they no longer wanted or needed. While not admitting liability, both businesses gave undertakings to make their automatically renewing subscriptions easier to understand and exit. The changes included giving customers whose subscription has auto-renewed a new right to obtain a pro-rata refund of the amount they were charged (after the existing refund window has expired). The changes make it easier for customers to get their money back if their subscription renews when they didn’t want it to. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) considered automatic renewal to be a “negative option offer”: a category that also includes, for example, continuity plans, free-to-pay or fee-to-pay conversions, and prenotification plans, and included it in its Enforcement Policy Statement in 2021 (Federal Trade Commission, 2021). The UK’s Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) also consulted on remedies to mitigate automatic renewal, including forcing customers to make an active choice about whether to accept automatic renewal at the start of the contract (BEIS, 2021). The consultation also recommended reminding consumers throughout that period, so they are aware of ongoing subscriptions and making it easier to cancel any subscriptions. Ranking The order of options has a large impact on the choices consumers make. Items appearing at the top of a list are more likely to be chosen than those later in the list in a range of contexts, including tweets (Agarwal, Xie, et al., 2011), Yahoo’s price comparison sites (Baye et al., 2009), and Google listings (Yang and Ghose, 2010). There are a few reasons for this, including that consumers use more cognitive effort (and perhaps more physical effort) to scroll down a list of items shown on their screens, rather than choosing the top options. Therefore, well-designed ranking options can help consumers make decisions efficiently. However, list compilers often also use paid ranking (also known as “sponsored ranking”). This means that businesses pay extra in exchange for a higher position in the search results. There are 2 types of paid ranking models (Netherlands Authority for Consumers and Markets, 2021): auction-based ranking (ie the platform holds several top or near-top rank spots that are sold via auctions) commission-based ranking (ie the platform gives better ranking position to the businesses that pay higher commission) When businesses are not transparent about the criteria used to generate the ranking, it may raise concerns that rankings reflect only what is in the business’s interest. Consumers may not understand that they are not seeing “organic” search results, and still expect to make an informed decision about their purchase based on those criteria, potentially distorting their decisions. This might refer to the instances where consumers misperceive rankings as objective recommendations (Netherlands Authority for Consumers and Markets, 2021). In the CMA’s publication on Algorithms (2021a), misleading or unfair ranking was defined as “the use of algorithmic systems to modify rankings to influence what a consumer sees to gain commercial advantage, but that ultimately degrades or misrepresents the offering to the consumer”. The publication also argued that paid ranking practices can make it harder for new businesses or products to be viewed by consumers because they cannot afford to pay their way up the list. This may mean that lists are no longer strictly ordered by quality or relevance, potentially leading to worse consumer decisions, lower trust in results and a distortion of competition, in which better quality results may not prevail (Competition and Markets Authority, 2021a). Furthermore, businesses with market power that both control the order of lists on their site and sell items or have a financial interest in items that appear on that list may also engage in self-preferencing, for example when they position their own products or products, they derive revenue from being higher up the list. The exploitation of market power in the list market may reduce choices for consumers, who often browse no further than the first page of results (Competition and Markets Authority, 2017d). However, the recommended choices do not need to even belong to the platform. They could also be linked to other businesses with which the platform has established relationship (for example, commission or revenue sharing). For example, Aguiar and Waldfogel (2021) analysed Spotify’s most-followed playlist to understand the extent to which Spotify has the ability to influence consumers’ listening choices. The findings showed that playlists owned and curated by Spotify have signficiant influence on streaming. If a song is placed within “Today’s Top Hits” playlist, it can increase its streaming potential by 20 million (Aguiar and Waldfogel, 2021). Effects on consumers and businesses A body of evidence on ranking and ordering showed primacy effects on choice, or advantages to being first or early in a sequence (Becker, 1954; Miller and Krosnick, 1998). These effects are also known as order effects or position bias, which is closely linked to consumer inertia and default effects. Most consumers start browsing at the top of lists, so higher ranked items are likely to receive more visibility. These primacy effects are especially salient online where higher ranked links are more likely to be clicked (Agarwal, Hosanagar, et al., 2011; Ghose and Yang, 2009; Yang and Ghose, 2010). For example, Ansari and Mela (2003) found that if the link in an email was displayed at the top, it led to a higher probability of being clicked by consumers. In addition, studies from the domain of eye-tracking (Duggan and Payne, 2011; Granka et al., 2004) showed that consumers’ attention tends to focus from top to bottom, skimming the available information by following the “F-pattern” of reading. In fact, across several contexts, items appearing higher up in a list are more likely to be chosen (see Figure 6). in a review of the literature on how consumers search online, the CMA (2017d) found that consumers focus mostly on the top search results, which is not only driven by the top results usually being more relevant but may be a result of an inherent consumer bias Figure 6. Example of ranking practice on a hotel booking website (Source: mock-up designed for the purpose of this paper) Figure 6 description: is a mock-up visual of ranking practices on hotel booking websites. It visualises a list of options, namely, Hotel A, Hotel B and Hotel C, in that order. The options are ranked based on number of reviews and star ratings, with the top-rated hotel appearing on the top of the list. Carare (2012) analysed sales ranking data of the top 100 applications that have been bought via Apple’s App Store. The findings showed that willingness to pay for the top-ranked product was approximately $4.50 greater than for the similar product when it is unranked. More specifically, the value attached to the highest rank spot was nearly double that of the value attached to the second highest rank spot Mullett, Smart and Stewart (2018) found that participants in an experiment were more likely to choose the product most suitable for them if its advert appeared first on a simulated social media feed In another experiment, Craswell et al. (2008) found that the first result in a list was more likely to be clicked than the second result, which was more likely to be clicked than the third. Differences were not statistically significant beyond the first 3 results, suggesting that consumers focus their attention on the top 3 However, Ursu (2018) in analysis of field experiment data at Expedia found that rankings influence what consumers search, but depending on the type of search, they might not influence purchase decisions. Ursu (2018) also showed that rankings lower search costs, instead of influencing consumer expectations or utility. Not only are items at the top of a list more likely to be chosen, but consumers also do not often change the order of a list – even when they can. For example, a Kantar Public report (Hanson et al., 2017) found that, of those consumers who had used a comparison website in the previous 3 months, only 28% had re-ordered their results. Overall, the findings showed that the factor(s) according to which online architects choose to order the options presented to consumers can have a significant influence on consumers’ decisions. Medium also seems to matter when it comes to ranking. Ghose et al. (2013) showed – using data from a South Korean microblogging website similar to Twitter – that ranking effects were stronger on mobile phones, suggesting higher search costs. For example, consumers find it harder to search for information on a small screen and they are more distracted when using mobile phones because they tend to browse for information in almost any context (for example while working, eating). Links that appear at the top of the screen and stores/supermarkets that are geographically nearby are especially likely to be clicked on mobile phones. One of the key drivers that influence choices made from a list is the effort required to scroll down (Ghose et al., 2013). This means that when consumers purposely look down the list of items, it requires a certain level of effort that can be viewed as a search cost. Even in a situation where the list of items is a result of browsing or undirected surfing, such effort is still linked to the likelihood of scanning all items on a list, and therefore can be viewed as a search cost (Yao and Mela, 2011). Other drivers for order and primacy effects are similar to those for defaults (and indeed, order and ranking effects may be considered a weaker form of default), including salience (Wang, 2017) and beliefs about quality or relevance, such that items appearing higher perform better (Brown and Krishna, 2004). Harm to Consumers and Competition Ranking can potentially cause harm to consumers and competition if the ordering is misleading. For example, consumers might expect that a platform ranks sellers in line with the consumer’s own interests (for example, by quality or price), but in fact sellers might be ranked by the commission they pay to the platform. This means that competition ends up occurring on the basis of which sellers can pay the most to the platform for the ranking, rather than which sellers actually offer consumers the best product. Such behaviour might mislead consumers. Consumers may also be misled if ranking and positioning is used to self-preference products or services from the business displaying the ranking. Drawing on evidence that consumers click far more often on results that are more visible, the European Commission concluded that Google had given its own Shopping comparison service a significant advantage over rivals because of its more prominent placement on the search page. The Commission therefore fined Google €2.4 billion for abusing dominance in breach of EU antitrust rules (European Commission, 2017b). In a paper discussing the Commission’s case, Fletcher (2019) noted that the “more favourable positioning” of results on the Google search page draws on saliency bias to increase traffic and click-throughs. She also argued that this practice might be particularly harmful for consumers who are “single homing” in that they do not shop around on other platforms. Furthermore, when it comes to self-preferencing, Bourreau and Gaudin (2022) argued that video streaming platforms might bias search results away from third-party content to increase bargaining leverage with content producers. Such situations can happen if there are dynamic threats or price constraints (for example, a “commitment” to provide organic traffic for free), which means their own content is systematically more profitable even if lower quality. However, such threats or constraints do not always apply; monetisation strategies and business models also matter. Bourreau and Gaudin (2022) focused on pricing structures where consumers pay a flat subscription, but content providers negotiate different ro\n",

      "Tens of thousands of workers across the country started returning to their offices and places of work today, as Covid-19 restrictions ease further. Rules around organised indoor group activities are also being relaxed, while limits on outdoor group activities for participants are being removed. The changes come some 18 months after non-essential workers who did not need to be in their workplaces to do their jobs were first directed by the Government to being working from home to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. The near overnight introduction of the rules forced many workers and their employers to adapt to a completely new way of remote working that they had not been used to. But with Covid-19 vaccination rates among those over the age of 12 years inching towards 90% and case numbers relatively stable, restrictions are now being eased. The Government has said that from today, attendance at work for specific business requirements may commence on a phased and staggered basis.

In many cases this means that pre-pandemic office capacity will have to be curtailed for the moment at least, with staff taking turns to come in and using hot desks while present. Where the distancing requirements cannot be maintained, employers will have to adopt work-around measures, such as screens and partitioned areas. The Health and Safety Authority is to continue to be the lead agency around workplace compliance with the protocols, and it and other State agencies will continue to carry out inspections. Also today, organised indoor group activities such as for sport, arts, culture and dance, can take place with capacity limits of 100 people where everyone is fully vaccinated or recovered from Covid-19 in the last six months. In circumstances where those attending have mixed immunity, pods of up to six participants will be permitted, excluding adult leaders and teachers. Multiple pods will be allowed subject to protective measures, with the number of pods dependent on the size of venue and substantial social distance between each one.

Your efforts to date have doubtless saved lives.\" But Mr Varadkar said the Government really wants to see remote working become a permanent fixture of Irish working life. \"I hope employers are speaking to their staff to figure out what works best for them and the business as this phased return begins,\" he said. The Minister of State for Business, Employment and Retail has urged anyone with concerns about their return to the workplace to contact the Health Safety Authority. Speaking on RTÉ's Drivetime, Damien English said each workplace should have a protocol plan in place to deal with any concerns employees have. Mr English said his department has also asked for a lead worker representative to be appointed in each workplace and that employees with concerns should contact this person and then, if necessary, these concerns can progress through management. He added the HSA is the lead organisation to carry out inspections and is working with other agencies including the HSE. The Meath West TD said a vaccinated employee, has the right to expect their employer to go to every length possible to protect them and to make the work environment safe, while acknowledging that the employer cannot compel another employee to get vaccinated. CIPD Ireland, the representative body for HR professionals, said for many workers the return to the workplace will be like starting a new job. \"In the coming weeks they will have to cope with changes to the work practices they've adopted while working from home during the last year,\" said CIPD Director, Mary Connaughton. \"It's another round of upheaval, albeit on a planned basis - and it should be acknowledged and thoughtfully dealt with.\" Vaccination status will remain a tricky issue for many employers because vaccination is not mandatory and it is not permissible for businesses to ask their staff what their vaccination status is. The Irish Men's Sheds Association will welcome back members after being shut during the pandemic. Speaking on RTÉ's Morning, CEO Enda Egan said there are concerns that around 55 sheds would not reopen, due to financial pressures and health issues meaning some members are no longer available to participate, while newer sheds have lost the leadership and momentum during lockdowns. He said that before the pandemic around 2% of members reported being lonely, and this rose to almost 40% during the pandemic.\n",

The report led by ISS and the health ministry examined data up to Aug. 29 from more than 29 million people who had received two doses of an mRNA vaccine such as those produced by Pfizer and Moderna. Advertisement 4 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content It said that in the general population, effectiveness against infection after seven months remained at 89 per cent, while against hospitalization and death, this time six months after the second dose, it remained at 96 per cent and 99 per cent respectively. The findings on protection from infection differ from a study carried out by Pfizer and published on Oct. 4 in the Lancet medical journal. That showed the effectiveness of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine in preventing infection dropped to 47 per cent from 88 per cent six months after the second dose. The ISS study did not make reference to the study in the Lancet, which focused on electronic health records of 3.4 million members of a U.S. healthcare provider but did not include data on adherence to mask guidelines and occupation, which could have affected testing frequency and exposure.

Article content In Italy, people are obliged to wear masks indoors and they had been required outdoors before the summer, and stringent behavioral rules have been in place, which may have influenced the results. The ISS report said that immunocompromised people saw their protection against infection drop from 28 days after the second dose, with the reduction varying widely according to which diseases cause the weakened immune system. In people with co-morbidities but who are not necessarily immunodepressed, the study reported a reduction in protection from infection which declined from 75 per cent 28 days after the second dose to 52 per cent after about seven months.

Dr. Katharine Smart says there’s a feeling of hopelessness among health-care workers in the country that their governments are not listening to them as they try to manage the pandemic and feel there’s no end in sight. “What is happening in the world when we have governments unwilling to listen to the people doing the job?” she told a news conference on Wednesday. She said when politicians in hard-hit jurisdictions talk about creating more hospital capacity to deal with steep COVID-19 caseloads, health-care workers feel the public isn’t getting the full picture because there is a lack of trained doctors and nurses able to properly care for patients in these extra beds. She added staff are being denied time off and forced to work mandatory overtime to cover for the shortages.

Article content As of last week, some 7,000 front-line health-care workers remained unvaccinated and could face suspension without pay after the government’s Oct. 15 deadline. Health Minister Christian Dubé said last week he had asked all the regional health networks to submit a plan by Oct. 1 on how to handle a possible lack of personnel after Oct. 15, but he has yet to publicize the details. Premier François Legault during question period Wednesday defended the mandatory vaccination plan, arguing he was incredulous that anyone would question the idea that health-care workers who treat patients need to be vaccinated. “I think he is sending a very bad message with his question this morning, suggesting that it would be a mistake to put compulsory vaccination in the health network on Oct. 15,” Legault said in response to a question from the Parti Québécois’s health critic.

He said only five of 1,000 health facilities have suspended certain services, such as obstetrics, but he said patients can get those services elsewhere. Dube, when pressed to clarify his plan on how to manage the possible loss of personnel, said the health network was working to reorganize schedules in light of the deadline. He also maintained that the government had taken action to alleviate the short staffing, pointing to a project announced earlier this week that will allow some ambulance paramedics to work in emergency rooms on Montreal’s south shore.

      "The Queen has said that having a COVID-19 vaccine \"didn't hurt at all\" as she encouraged those who are hesitant about getting jabbed to \"think about other people rather than themselves\". Her Majesty, who never talks about her own private health matters in public, endorsed the importance of the vaccination programme during a video call to those coordinating the operations across England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Talking about her own experience of having the COVID jab in January, the Queen said: \"Once you've had the vaccine you have a feeling of, you know, you're protected, which is I think very important. \"As far as I could make out it was quite harmless. It was very quick, and I've had lots of letters from people who have been very surprised by how easy it was to get the vaccine.

Acknowledging the low uptake in certain communities, revealed by Sky News analysis to be concentrated in the UK's major cities, the 94-year-old monarch said: \"I think the other thing is, that it is obviously difficult for people if they've never had a vaccine...

      "HARARE, Zimbabwe - When mother-of-three Amanda Wood heard that hundreds of coronavirus shots were available for teens, only one thing prevented her from racing to the vaccination site at a Toronto high school -- her 13-year-old daughter's fear of needles. Wood told Lola: If you get the vaccine you'll be able to see your friends again. You'll be able to play sports. And enticed by the promise of resuming a normal, teen life, Lola agreed. In Zimbabwe, more than 8,000 miles (13,000 kilometres) and a world away from Canada, immunity is harder to obtain. On a recent day, Andrew Ngwenya sat outside his home in a working-class township in Harare, the capital, pondering how he could save himself and his family from COVID-19. Ngwenya and his wife De-egma had gone to a hospital that sometimes had spare doses. Hours later, fewer than 30 people had been inoculated. The Ngwenyas, parents of four children, were sent home, still desperate for immunization. \"We are willing to have it but we can't access it,\" he said. \"We need it, where can we get it?\" The stories of the Wood and Ngwenya families reflect a world starkly divided between vaccine haves and have nots, between those who can imagine a world beyond the pandemic and those who can only foresee months and perhaps years of illness and death. In one country, early stumbles in the fight against COVID-19 were overcome thanks to money and a strong public health infrastructure. In the other, poor planning, a lack of resources and the failure of a global mechanism intended to share scarce vaccines have led to a desperate shortage of COVID-19 shots -- and oxygen tanks and protective equipment, as well. With 70% of its adult population receiving at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, Canada has among the world's highest vaccination rate and is now moving on to immunize children, who are at far lower risk of coronavirus complications and death. Meanwhile, only about 9% of the population in Zimbabwe has received one dose of coronavirus vaccine amid a surge of the easier-to-spread delta variant, first seen in India. Many millions of people vulnerable to COVID-19, including the elderly and those with underlying medical problems, are struggling to get immunized as government officials introduce more restrictive measures. Ngwenya said the crush of people trying to get vaccinated is disheartening. \"The queue is like 5 kilometres (about 3 miles) long. Even if you are interested in a jab you can't stand that. Once you see the queue you won't try again,\" he said Vaccines weren't always plentiful in Canada. With no domestic coronavirus vaccine production, the country got off to a sluggish start, with immunization rates behind those in Hungary, Greece and Chile. Canada was also the only G7 country to secure vaccines in the first round of deliveries by a UN-backed effort set up to distribute COVID-19 doses primarily to poor countries known as COVAX. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said it had always been Canada's intention to secure vaccines through COVAX, after investing more than $400 million in the project. The vaccines alliance, Gavi, said COVAX was also meant to provide rich countries with an \"insurance policy\" in case they didn't have enough shots. COVAX's latest shipment to Canada -- about 655,000 AstraZeneca vaccines -- arrived in May, shortly after about 60 poor countries were left in the lurch when the initiative's supplies slowed to a trickle. Bangladesh, for example, had been awaiting a COVAX delivery of about 130,000 vaccines for its Rohingya refugee population; the shots never arrived after the Indian supplier ceased exports. Canada's decision to secure vaccines through the UN-backed effort was \"morally reprehensible,\" said Dr. Prabhat Jha, chair of global health and epidemiology at the University of Toronto. He said Canada's early response to COVID-19 badly misjudged the need for control measures including aggressive contact tracing and border restrictions. \"If not for Canada's purchasing power to procure vaccines, we would be in bad shape right now,\" he said. Weeks after the COVAX vaccines arrived, more than 33,000 doses were still sitting in warehouses in Ottawa after health officials recommended Canadians get shots made by Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna instead -- of which they had bought tens of millions of doses. The Wood children got the Pfizer vaccine. When Canada began immunizing children aged 12 and over, Wood, who works with children in the entertainment industry and her architect husband didn't hesitate. Wood said her children, who are all avid athletes, have been unable to play much hockey, soccer or rugby during repeated lockdowns. Lola has missed baking lemon loaves and chocolate chip cookies with her grandmother, who lives three blocks away. \"We felt we had to do our part to keep everyone safe, to keep the elderly safe, and to get the economy going again and the kids back to school,\" she said. In Zimbabwe, there is no expectation of a return to normal anytime soon, and things are likely to get worse -- Ngwenya worries about government threats to bar the unvaccinated from public services, including transport. Although Zimbabwe was allocated nearly 1 million coronavirus vaccines through COVAX, none have been delivered. Its mix of purchased and donated shots -- 4.2 million -- consist of Chinese, Russian and Indian vaccines. Official figures show that 4% of the country's 15 million population are now fully immunized. The figures make Zimbabwe a relative success in Africa, where fewer than 2% of the continent's 1. 3 billion people have been vaccinated, according to the World Health Organization. Meanwhile, the virus is spreading to rural areas where the majority live and health facilities are shambolic. Ngwenya is a part-time pastor with a Pentecostal church; he said he and his flock have had to rely on their faith to fight the coronavirus. But he said people would rather have vaccines first, and then prayer. \"Every man is scared of death,\" he said. \"People are dying and we can see people dying. This is real.\" ------ Cheng reported from London. Lori Hinnant in Paris contributed to this report.\n",

      "The government is \"considering\" scrapping quarantine requirements for those who have had both vaccine doses. Downing Street said it was looking at whether to drop all legal self-isolation measures for fully vaccinated people who come into contact with someone who is infected \"as part of the post-Step 4 world\". Ministers had already been considering replacing self-isolation with daily testing depending on the results of a number of pilots currently being carried out. But officials confirmed this weekend that additional thought was going into making the testing requirement advisory rather than mandatory for those who have had two jabs. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 1:11 PM 'confident' two jabs will enable travel If approved, the plan would not come into force on so-called \"freedom day\" on 19 July, with sources indicating that the timeline would be \"quite a bit later\" than the planned date for the end of all restrictions. Advertisement That is likely to face opposition given the disruption that isolation may cause over the summer as cases increase. Several different proposals are understood to be under consideration with no final decisions yet made. Plans to allow double-vaccinated people to avoid quarantine when travelling back from amber list countries are also being considered with an announcement on the plan due next week. A scientific adviser has said the problems associated with allowing people who have both jabs to benefit from an exemption \"outweigh the potential benefits\" and warned that it could cause \"resentment\". Professor Robert West, a health psychologist who is a member of the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Behaviours (SPI-B), told Times Radio: \"The most serious problem is that if you have a situation where not everyone has been even offered the vaccine then you've already got clearly a huge unfairness. \"When you get unfairness in situations like this, you get resentment and when you get resentment you can get loss of compliance.\" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 0:36 Booster jabs 'will keep the virus at bay' But his assertion has been challenged by other medical experts, who said it would be \"perfectly OK\" to allow those who are fully inoculated more freedoms. Dr Bharat Pankhania, a senior clinical lecturer in communicable diseases at the University of Exeter, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that vaccines were breaking the link between cases, hospital admissions and deaths, meaning \"we can start thinking about other uncoupling measures, such as no need to quarantine after being fully immunised\". Epidemiologist Professor Christophe Fraser, who advised the Department of Health on test and trace, said a \"midway\" proposal could be that those who have received both jabs are tested every day instead of undertaking a quarantine period. Follow the Daily podcast on Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts, Spotify, Spreaker The Oxford University academic said he agreed the self-isolation policy \"needs to be reviewed in light of the data on the vaccine effectiveness\". The debate about extra rights for those who have been vaccinated is playing out amid a background of an \"alarming\" rise in COVID-19 cases in England. The latest figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show that about one in 260 people in private households in England had COVID in the week to 26 June - up from one in 440 in the previous week and the highest level since the week to 27 February. The increase has caused leading doctors to urge the government to keep some restrictions in place in England after 19 July in a bid to stem the rate of infection. The British Medical Association (BMA) said that keeping some protective measures in place was \"crucial\" to stop spiralling case numbers having a \"devastating impact\" on people's health, the NHS, the economy and education.\n",

Article content 2:15 p.m. Return-to-office plans unravel as workers rebel in tight job market From the Bloomberg news agency: Even the most inflexible bosses are softening their return-to-office expectations. JPMorgan Chase & Co. chief Jamie Dimon has been one of the most vocal critics of remote work, arguing that it’s no substitute for the spontaneous idea generation that results from bumping into colleagues at the coffee machine. But in his annual letter to shareholders last month, the head of America’s biggest bank allowed that working from home “will become more permanent in American business,” and estimated that about 40 per cent of his 270,000-person workforce would work under a hybrid model, which includes days in the office and at home. Advertisement 5 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content Soon after Dimon’s missive, one of the bank’s senior technology executives told some teams that they could cut back from three days in the office per week to two, citing internal feedback. Many white-collar workplaces are making similar retreats as their employees stubbornly stick to working from home while struggling with childcare, the grind of commuting and worries about rising COVID-19 cases. Bosses are wary of taking punitive action against those who aren’t following their ambitious so-called RTO plans, fearing it will backfire in today’s tight labour market. That leaves them to reevaluate their carefully crafted strategies and reconsider what is a realistic long-term approach to in-person work.

Article content “We are seeing policies slip in real-time,” said Melissa Swift, the U.S. transformation leader at workforce consultant Mercer. “There was previously all this talk about how, for white-collar jobs, collaborating in the office was important. That’s slipping. Now, only the people who need to turn a screwdriver need to be in the office.” Not all workers are rebelling against directives to return the office, with variation across companies, sectors and job categories. Still, employers are seeing fresh reasons to doubt the viability of their RTO guidelines. People are coming back to just about everything else — travel, restaurants, concerts, stores — amid a general loosening in state and federal COVID-related restrictions. So executives can no longer reassure themselves that workers would dutifully come back once those rules are relaxed. Advertisement 7 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content At the same time, organizations that returned to the office in the first few months of the year now have loads of feedback from employees, many of whom are frustrated by commuting in just to spend half their day on Zoom calls. That adds to two full years of data on how workforces remained just as productive — and often were more satisfied — while working from home, and emerging research from academics. The result is a groundswell of hard evidence that can convince even the staunchest remote-work skeptics. Examples of RTO resistance abound. At Apple Inc., a small group of employees has pushed back against the iPhone maker’s plan that will soon require most corporate workers to be in the office three days a week. A worker group called Apple Together penned an open letter to company leadership last month, in which signatories asked “to decide for ourselves, together with our teams and direct manager, what kind of work arrangement works best for each one of us.” The staffers also dismissed the oft-cited desire for in-person collaboration, saying “this is not something we need every week, often not even every month, definitely not every day.” Apple declined to comment.

Airbnb Inc. had previously pegged September 2022 as its return to the office, but Chief Executive Officer Brian Chesky dumped that plan last month, instead telling his 6,000 employees that they could work remotely indefinitely. “Each of us works best in our own ways, and we’re giving you the flexibility to make the right choice based on where you’re most productive,” Chesky wrote in an email to staff. 2:10 p.m. Many Canadians would take less pay to work from home, survey suggests Nearly two in five (36 per cent) Canadian remote or partly-remote workers say they would be willing to take a lower-paying job for the option of working from home, compared to a higher-paying role that requires full-time work at the office, according to an Ipsos survey for Global News.

He said the picture has improved so much that he will no longer be providing weekly pandemic updates. Boileau addressed confusion about Quebec’s stand on booster shots (third and fourth doses). Third doses are recommended for all adults as well as pregnant women and health workers, and people 12 to 17 who are at high risk of complications from COVID. Advertisement 10 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content As for fourth doses, it’s only recommended for specific groups. That includes people who live in congregate settings such as long-term care homes and seniors’ residences, as well as Quebecers 80 and older who live in the community and people who are immunocompromised. Last week, all adults became eligible for fourth doses, Boileau noted. However, there is no recommendation as to whether this part of the general population should get the fourth shot, he added. Fourth doses can be administered three months after the third dose. Boileau was accompanied by Dr. Caroline Quach, an infectious disease specialist at Ste. Justine Hospital and president of the Comité sur l’immunisation du Québec, which advises the province on vaccination issues.

Getting another shot does increase protection against infection and hospitalization, she said. “The difficulty is the timing,” Quach added. “What we want is to have maximum protection at the moment when we have the most cases.” Noting the situation in Quebec has improved considerably, she said for people for whom the shot is not recommended getting it now would boost immunity but it wouldn’t do much good because community spread is low. Quach did not mention any possible negative consequences of getting a fourth dose. Some Quebec experts have suggested that people age 18 to 59 should consider getting the shot. They include Dr. Donald Vinh, an infectious-diseases specialist and medical microbiologist at the McGill University Health Centre, and Dr. André Veillette, an immunologist at the Montreal Clinical Research Institute.

Article content As of 12:01 a.m. on Saturday (May 14), Quebec will drop its mask mandate for most indoor places. Boileau said he does not expect the number of cases to rise as fewer people wear masks. But he urged people who are at the highest risk to continue to cover up. Masks will still be required on public transit, in long-term care homes (CHSLDs) as well as in health care institutions. Boileau has previously said that masks will be lifted on buses, subways and trains at some point in the spring.

The Quebec government health-care research institute said it expects a decrease in the number of new hospitalizations to about 55 daily. In its previous update, published last week, the INESSS forecast about 90 new daily hospitalizations. A week before that it was projecting about 150 new hospitalizations daily. In today’s update, the INESSS said it also expects a decrease in the number of regular and intensive-care beds occupied by COVID patients.

There were 951 last week (April 30 to May 6), compared to 1,287 the previous week. The decrease was observed in all age groups and in all regions, the INESSS said. #COVID19📊3e semaine ⬇ nbre nouveau cas hospitaliers, dans tous groupes d’âge et toutes les régions. #Projections D’ici 2 semaines : environ 55 nouvelles hospitalisations quotidiennes. ⬇ nbre de lits rég et SI occupés par patients COVID. 👉https://t.co/XfDI31va8r pic.twitter.com/SSwpV4efHi — INESSS (@INESSS_Qc) May 11, 2022 Advertisement 15 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.

Multiple airports are reporting extremely long lines at airport security and border screening checkpoints while passengers say they are being forced to wait for hours — and sometimes missing their flights. The Greater Toronto Airports Authority said last week that staffing challenges at the Canadian Air Transport Security Authority were contributing to long lines at Toronto’s Pearson Airport. Advertisement 16 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content But Alghabra says CATSA staffing is at 90 per cent of pre-pandemic levels while flight volumes are still below 70 per cent, so that can’t be the main problem. Rather, he says out-of-practice travellers are causing delays at security checkpoints as Canadians shift back into travel mode after spending most of the last two years grounded by COVID-19. Alghabra says changing flight schedules have also resulted in large volumes of flights leaving and arriving at the same time, causing big bottlenecks at certain times of the day. 11:30 a.m. Montreal to end state of emergency on May 19 The city of Montreal this morning announced that it will end its state of emergency on May 19. Thanks to a high vaccination rate and improving COVID-19 situation, the city “expects to be able to carry out its emergency actions without depending on the exceptional powers linked to the local state of emergency,” the city said in a press release. Advertisement 17 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content Montreal declared a state of emergency when the pandemic hit in 2020. It was lifted at the end of August 2021, after 17 months. On Dec. 21, in response to the increase in new COVID-19 cases caused by the Omicron variant, the city reinstated the state of emergency. Among other things, the state of emergency allows Montreal to immediately purchase protective gear and rapid tests for municipal employees who provide essential public services. Examples are firefighters, police, workers at water filtration plants and blue collars involved in snow removal. 11:25 a.m. Chart: Current situation vs. one year ago 11:25 a.m. Charts: Quebec cases, deaths 11:25 a.m. Charts: Quebec’s vaccination campaign 11:05 a.m. Quebec reports 23 new deaths as hospitalizations fall below 1,900 Advertisement 18 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.

Wearing face masks at airports and inflight should be aligned with national measures, the European Union Aviation Safety Agency said in a protocol published on Wednesday. If either the departure or destination states require the wearing of face masks on public transport, aircraft operators should ask passengers and crew to comply, the agency said. “From next week, face masks will no longer need to be mandatory in air travel in all cases, broadly aligning with the changing requirements of national authorities across Europe for public transport,” EASA Executive Director Patrick Ky said in a press release. The new guidelines comes into effect on May 16. Advertisement 21 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content The recommendation follows the latest scientific evidence and expert opinion from the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control. Many airlines, including Brussels Airlines, have already announced that they won’t enforce masking rules in flight. The easing of restrictions is adding confidence to Europe’s biggest airlines, which are kicking off summer operations amid a surge in bookings. The protocol relaxes last June’s strict recommendation of mandating medical face masks for all passengers and persons at the airport and in the aircraft. Aircraft operators, however, should continue encouraging passengers and crew to wear masks during the flight and in the airport, even when not required, as it is still one of the best ways to protect against the virus transmission, the agencies said.

Provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry said Tuesday nearly 94 per cent of practising and regulated professionals have received at least two doses of a vaccine or have a medical exemption from her office as of April 25. Advertisement 23 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content Provincial data shows 98 per cent of physicians and surgeons are vaccinated, the highest rate among health-care professionals, while naturopaths are the lowest at 69 per cent. Chinese medicine practitioners and acupuncturists have a vaccination rate of 79 per cent. The vaccination figures for the BC College of Nurses and Midwives are still being collected and are expected to be released over the next few weeks. The government is working with each college to ensure that health-care professionals can declare their immunization status without disclosing personal information, Henry said. “The overriding principle is patient safety, and making it safe for people to ask those questions.” It may be as simple as when a person books an appointment, they would be asked if they have a preference of seeing a practitioner who is vaccinated, she said.

She likened it to a person asking their physician if they washed their hands. “One of the programs that we’ve talked about a lot is that it’s OK to ask your health-care provider if they clean their hands,” she told a news conference. The overriding interest is to ensure that people can make an informed decision and feel safe when receiving care from their chosen providers, Henry said. 10 a.m. Advertisement 25 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.

Article content Ottawa Public Health reported 48 new cases on Monday and no new deaths. There are 15 people in hospital with COVID-19, with eight of those patients in intensive care. OPH reported one new outbreak in the community and none in health care and other institutions, or schools and child-care facilities. There are 463 active cases of COVID-19 in the city. Across the province, 186 people are in hospital with the illness, with 184 patients in ICU, although some hospitals did not report data on the weekend. Among the people in ICU, seven are fully vaccinated, 11 are partially vaccinated, 102 are unvaccinated, and the vaccination status of 64 people isn’t known. Just outside of Ottawa, the public health unit in Eastern Ontario reported 35 new cases; Kingston, Frontenac and Lennox & Addington reported one; and both Leeds, Grenville and Lanark and Renfrew County reported none.

The highest is in Chatham-Kent, with 104.40 active cases of the disease per 100,000 people, followed by Eastern Ontario with 103 cases and Brant Country with 81.3 cases. In contrast, Ottawa has 45.5 active cases per 100,000 population. COVID-19 VACCINE NEWS AND UPDATES On the COVID-19 vaccine front, 85.9 per cent of eligible Ontario residents have now received one dose and 80.3 per cent have two doses, Health Minister Christine Elliott tweeted on Monday morning. The vaccine has been approved for people ages 12 and older. Elliott said Ontario is considering adding the COVID-19 vaccine to the list of vaccines children must have to attend school. Advertisement 4 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content When asked about the issue during a media conference on another matter Monday morning, Elliott made no promises but said the government is studying the idea of adding the COVID-19 vaccine to the list of nine immunizations under the province’s Immunization of School Pupils Act. “We want to have as many people vaccinated as is safe and possible, so we are continuing to look at ways that we can continue with that, and that is one of the ways that we are looking at,” she said. Toronto’s Medical Officer of Health Eileen de Villar recently joined those who have been calling for the government to make vaccines mandatory for all eligible students. The idea of mandatory COVID-19 vaccinations for school children is also supported by associations representing Ontario’s English public school boards, unions representing education workers and nurses and the Ontario Medical Association, among others. Advertisement 5 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content Elementary and secondary students must now be immunized against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis (whooping cough), poliomyelitis, measles, mumps, rubella, meningococcal disease, and varicella (chickenpox, for those born the year of/after 2010). Vaccine exemptions are allowed for both medical and personal reasons under the Ontario act. Elliott said the take-up of COVID-19 vaccines among the province’s 12 to 17-year-olds has been good, and the government is now waiting for the authorization of the Pfizer vaccine for younger children. Officials at Pfizer said last week that they expected to make an application for the approval of a vaccine for children from age 4 to 11 in the next few days. Ontario Medical Officer of Health Dr. Kieran Moore was asked earlier this month whether the province would add the COVID-19 shot to the list of immunizations under the provincial law. Advertisement 6 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content He responded by saying the province is improving information flow by creating digital records so public health units can instantly check which students are immunized against COVID-19, which would enable “public health to understand, in almost real time, the risk in any classroom. So I think that is the best solution in a short time frame that we could achieve, and I think it meets the needs of public health, it meets the needs of parents, as well as school boards.” Organizations can also put in place “additional policies and measures based on local context,” said Alexandra Hilkene, the spokesperson for Elliott. The Ottawa-Carleton District School board has debated a proposal to require students to be vaccinated, and the recommendation was rejected, although it must still go to the board for a final debate. Some trustees said they were not medical professionals and were reluctant to enforce a policy that had not been recommended by Ottawa Public Health, while others said they worried students who were not vaccinated because of parental pressure would be unfairly penalized.

For example, school boards have been asked to host vaccination clinics at or near schools to make it easier for students to get their shots. COVID-19 IN OTTAWA SCHOOLS The number of outbreaks at Ottawa schools now stands at 14, with Ottawa Public Health to provide a further update Monday afternoon. Another three school outbreaks, all of them at the French Catholic School board, have been resolved. The largest active school outbreak is at Montfort elementary school, which has 10 people with active cases of COVID-19 and five more cases that have been resolved, according to the Conseil des écoles catholiques du Centre-Est update on Monday morning.

ACROSS CANADA In Alberta, Premier Jason Kenney rejected calls for a “hard lockdown” as the province’s former top doctor signed a letter calling for immediate “fire break” measures to deal with surging cases of COVID-19 in the province. Kenney told radio host Roy Green on Sunday that a lockdown would make “no sense for the 80 per cent of the population that is vaccinated,” and who he said are much less likely to transmit the disease and are far less likely to be hospitalized. The roughly 20 per cent of people who aren’t vaccinated and are behind the surge in cases are less likely to follow public health measures, said Kenney.

Article content Alberta’s former chief medical officer of health, Dr. James Talbot, and critical care specialist Dr. Noel Gibney, signed an open letter Sunday to the province’s new health minister, Jason Copping, calling on him to take action to “prevent more disease, deaths, and suffering.” They called for measures that include the transfer of ICU patients to other provinces now in order to relieve pressure on hospitals and delay the need for triage protocols. They also called for a set of “fire break” closures and restrictions for a minimum of four weeks for bars, gyms, casinos, indoor dining and sports facilities. “We are within days of being forced to implement a triage protocol which will force health-care workers to make life and death decisions on who will get scarce resources, like ventilators. Those that do not are likely to die,” said the letter from the doctors. Advertisement 10 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content “Albertan’s hospital system, especially ICUs are under more killing stress than at any time in the province’s history.” Alberta has more than 20,000 active COVID-19 cases and is seeing well over 1,000 new cases each day. On Friday, the Canadian Armed Forces prepared to bring in air transport and staff to deal with the COVID-19 crisis overwhelming Alberta’s hospitals. Kenney told Green that Ontario was in a similar predicament with COVID-19 in the spring, despite having much more intensive restrictions in place. He also noted that Alberta took in patients from Manitoba earlier this year, despite what he called a hard lockdown there. He also continued to defend his government’s elimination of restrictions on July 1, which many have blamed for the surge.

Article content “I don’t think we were wrong to drop public health restrictions in the summer, on July 1. We saw the numbers continue to go down for five to six weeks after that,” Kenney told Green. “How could I have possibly justified what the Opposition and others wanted, which was continued damaging restrictions when there was no evidence to support that?” In B.C., starting Monday residents in B.C. will have to show a vaccine card to dine at most restaurants and participate in many indoor recreational events. The card is now the only acceptable proof of vaccination in British Columbia after a transition period ended when people could present records from their immunization appointments instead. Health Minister Adrian Dix says more than three million people in B.C. have already received their vaccine card. People can get their card online from the government’s website and keep a digital copy on their mobile device or print a hard copy.

      "Fresh measures designed to deal with the emergence of the new COVID-19 variant Omicron have come into force in England. They were announced by Prime Minster Boris Johnson at the weekend amid concern the new variant could be less responsive to vaccines and more infectious. Mask wearing in England is now compulsory in shops, public transport, hairdressers, post offices and banks, unless you are exempt.

      "England's deputy chief medical officer Professor Jonathan Van-Tam has appeared on Sky News to answer some questions from the public on the coronavirus crisis. He shared his perspective on the public's queries and concerns on topics including the vaccine rollout, vaccine hesitancy and lifting the lockdown. Live COVID updates from the UK and around the world Below are some of the key things from the Q&A, followed by a short analysis from science correspondent Thomas Moore, who offers his insight on each answer. 1. Since we hit the first 15 million jabs target there has been a drop-off in the daily vaccination numbers. Why? Advertisement \"That's really very simple to explain. There are always going to be supply fluctuations. These are new vaccines and by and large the manufacturers have never made them or anything like them before,\" Professor Van-Tam said. Using one of his now-famous analogies Prof Van-Tam compared the manufacture of vaccines to beer-making. He said you set the equipment up and let it do its thing. He said the end product is not always the same and that the yield might be different each time. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 0:53 'Vaccine production is like beer-making' \"You do get batch size variations and that's natural.\" He says it's going to take few months for manufacturers to get a confident and steady routine. He said there are global supply restraints but that the UK is in an \"amazing place in the world\". He says he thinks the numbers will pick up again. Thomas Moore says: Supply is the big uncertainly in the vaccine rollout timetable. Both AstraZeneca and Pfizer have had problems in scaling up production to meet delivery targets. The analogy with beer-making is good - but vaccines have to meet the strictest tests on quality, sterility and stability and that's a high bar. 2. How concerned are you about vaccine hesitancy in ethnic and working class communities? \"I am concerned about this,\" he said, and says the NHS is set to reveal data on this issue. Prof Van-Tam pointed out that this has been an issue with any vaccines for \"decades\" - particularly in areas of high deprivation. \"We need very high uptake\" to give us the best chance of going \"where we really want to be\" with the roadmap, he said. Professor Van-Tam added there is no \"magic number\" of uptake required, and the aim isn't herd immunity - and adds that he's been pleasantly surprised by uptake. Thomas Moore says: There are complex reasons why some communities may not respond as well to health information - not just on vaccination, but screening tests and advice on healthy eating. The government will have to tailor its pitch to address the reasons why any one group may be reluctant to come forward. A high uptake, even if it doesn't achieve herd immunity, is the only way to reduce the virus to low levels in the population. These vaccines are not 100% effective, so there will always be some elderly people still vulnerable to the disease. Image: Vaccine hesitancy has been widespread in ethnic and working class communities 3. How do you know the vaccine will not affect my chances of infertility? \"First of all it is just not biologically logical that they would. Secondly, no vaccine has ever done this,\" Professor Van-Tam said. \"Getting COVID does affect your long-term chances of life and that's a pretty important counter-balance.\" Thomas Moore says: Good myth-busting from JVT. There is some rubbish being spread on social media and he is right to dismiss it. 4. With schools heading back on 8 March why are we not vaccinating teachers as a priority? Prof Van-Tam said the UK is vaccinating as a priority the people who have the highest risk of dying from COVID-19. He says once that is done, the country will vaccinate those at the highest risk of being hospitalised with COVID. He said data shows for teachers of both sexes the rate of death between 9 March and 28 December 2020 has been 18.4/100,000 for men and 9.8/100,000 for women. Image: A headteacher wearing PPE prepares for his school to reopen If you compare that with the same age and sex population, the figures are lower than those - 31.4/100,000 for men and 16.8/100,000 for women. \"It is clear there is no excess mortality overall in teachers,\" he said, adding that any teachers who are at risk will be \"picked up\" by the JCVI (Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation) and vaccinated faster. Thomas Moore says: Actually some data shows that male teachers in secondary schools are at higher risk than other professions. But generally teachers are at no more risk and squeezing them in between the current priority groups risks slowing the rollout to people more likely to end up in hospital. Once all over-50s have had the jab there would be a good case to put teachers, and other professions with high public contact, front of the queue. But the NHS records birth date not occupation - so, again, age is judged the fastest way of protecting all adults. 5. Why does COVID impact some people more than others? Prof Van-Tam said risk factors for how seriously ill people get with COVID is down to \"age, age, and age - it's the absolute driver and the biggest factor\". He said other factors include underlying health conditions, and men are more badly affected - consistently across the ages, as well as the obese. \"We know why it's more likely to be serious for some than it is for others,\" he said. He added: \"If you take two 50-year-old males, why does one have milder symptoms and one ends up in ICU? That's because the body's immune response is different in people in relation to COVID infection, and we don't know all the answers to that yet.\" Thomas Moore says: This virus is a puzzle. How can it kill some but not even cause symptoms in others. After more than a year of study we still don't know the underlying immunological effect of the virus. And without knowing the root cause it's hard to develop effective treatments 6. How and when will we know if we will need a booster shot in winter? Prof Van-Tam said we need further data on how immunity protection lasts after people have had the current vaccines. He said the emergence of new variants also needs to be watched carefully as they do have the potential to \"outwit\" the current vaccines. Image: Booster jabs for COVID-19 during winter are being discussed by scientists He said we could end up revaccinating if immunity does not last in some parts of the population or because of the development of new variants. But he added that all of the vaccine data has shown that they are \"absolutely working against the so-called Kent variant\". Thomas Moore says: The expectation of most scientists is that we will have to give a booster, at least to the most vulnerable, and probably this autumn. The variants won't just be brought back from abroad as people start to travel again, they can be homegrown. Both the original UK virus and the Kent variant have mutated to evade the immune system. And as more people develop antibodies through infection or vaccination around the world the virus is put under increasing evolutionary pressure to mutate to survive.\n",

      "When I got my discharge papers to leave the hospital, I was ecstatic. I was so eager to put Covid in the rearview and move on with my life. But little did I know, my hospitalization was just the beginning of my journey. The early weeks of my recovery seemed to be going well. Yes, there were endless doctor's appointments, but it seemed like a small price to pay to be out of isolation and back at home. That rosy perspective started to wilt away about 6 weeks into my recovery. When I left the hospital, it took me two weeks to build the confidence and lung capacity to walk up a single flight of stairs. Weeks later I noticed I was suddenly more winded than ever and experiencing some Covid-like symptoms that I never experienced with my initial diagnosis. Twelve steps down a hallway and my heart would beat so heavily, I could hear it in my ears and physically see my heart beating through my chest. My Apple Watch would congratulate me for completing a full workout, when all I had done was take a few steps from the couch to the kitchen. READ MORE: Maurille Lue returns home after week in hospital with COVID-19 After the sudden onset of shortness of breath came what seemed like forgetfulness…forgetting where I put my keys or wondering if I locked the door, but it escalated quickly. I knew it was more than forgetfulness when I couldn't remember if I had fed my dog. I tried to come up with tricks to remind myself to feed him, I tried to make charts and notes but nothing worked. I second guessed myself so much that I ended up over-feeding my dog! Hampton enjoyed the extra food, but his waistline did not. He gained extra weight and had to be put on a special diet and exercise routine. I was so weak one of my neighbors kindly volunteered to walk him twice a day until I was strong enough. It was a terrible feeling. I started losing weight. I had zero appetite and even though I never lost my sense of taste or smell when I had Covid, suddenly my sense of taste came in waves. The self-proclaimed queen of sugar could no longer stomach a cookie or a piece of cake. It was not a healthy decision, but I often went days without eating, I just wasn't hungry - nothing tasted the same. Nothing smelled the same. You want to shock your brain? Try eating tomato soup that tastes like hot bananas. Imagine a piping hot plate of your favorite food coming to the table, you lean for a big whiff and nearly lose it because all you can smell is that very pungent - very specific - stench of cat urine. I have a cat, so naturally I thought my cat had finally taken her revenge for getting a dog. I scurried out of grocery and department stores, dry heaving at the cat smell odor so strong I could taste it. I was so isolated, it was nearly a month before I realized that I was the only one who could smell it. I stopped taking phone calls because I couldn’t hear the person talking to me over the ringing in my ears. The more I longed to get back to my old self, the more I felt like a shell of who I used to be. I would plan social experiences with friends only to feel so fatigued that I was physically incapable of getting out of bed. Fatigue and chronic pain are two symptoms attributed to long Covid, but those words don't feel severe enough. When I first returned to work I was so happy to be back with my friends and doing what I loved. However, I quickly realized nothing would be the same. There were days that I would have no choice but to get back in the bed before the day even started because just getting dressed for work completely wiped me out. More often than not, I wake up with limbs that feel so heavy I think my knees will buckle with every step. The muscle stiffness and joint pain are so severe that I can only describe the experience as \"early onset rigor mortis\". Symptoms for Long Haul Covid range from shortness of breath, anxiety and depression to organ damage and short term memory loss. For me, the cognitive distortion, known as brain fog, has been the biggest obstacle to overcome. I have been driving to FOX 2 for almost 10 years, now I use navigation to drive to the office because sometimes I forget how to get to the studio. It feels impossible to complete a simple task without getting distracted enough to forget entirely what I was doing. Important names, dates and special memories for now are all gone. I am praying they come back. I have no recollection of last Christmas or the last time I saw my family. Intellectually, I know It was in May, but I don't remember it. I see pictures of myself out with friends or at an event and am instantly confused because I don't recall anything about the evening or why I wore that sweater. I am learning to cope with my new normal. There is still so much to learn about Covid and Long Covid. Our understanding about why some people are affected differently by Covid is evolving every day. Why do some people have no symptoms at all, while others are left with organ damage and lasting disabilities? Long Haulers are scared, we feel alone, we need support.\n",

      "The government's new Covid-19 rules will have significant ramifications for football fans up and down the country, with proof of double vaccination or a negative lateral flow test required to attend sporting events with crowds of more than 10,000 people. Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced the rules as part of the government's 'plan B' to combat the spread of the Omicron variant of Covid-19 and the proposals were voted into force in the House of Commons on December 14 by a majority of 243. National rises in Covid cases have already had an impact on the Premier League, which approved Manchester United's request to postpone their fixture at Brentford and also sanctioned the postponement of Tottenham's trip to Brighton. But what exactly will fans need to do on matchdays? And are Premier League clubs ready to implement the changes? We answer the key questions. What does it mean for me? To attend a Premier League game, you must now either show proof of double vaccination via the NHS Covid app, or proof of a negative lateral flow test taken inside the previous 48 hours. The rules are intended to \"[help] keep these events and venues open at full capacity while giving everyone who attends them confidence that those around them have done the responsible thing to minimise risk to others,\" said the Prime Minister. When do the rules come into force? The rules come into force on Wednesday December 15, meaning the four Premier League games taking place that evening - Brighton vs Wolves, Burnley vs Watford, Crystal Palace vs Southampton and Arsenal vs West Ham - will be the first at which they are applied. Image: Arsenal's Emirates Stadium will host one of the first games at which the new rules will apply How do I get a Covid pass? Fans can get a domestic Covid pass via the NHS Covid app if they are 18 or over, registered with a GP, and meet any of the following criteria: It has been at least two weeks since their second vaccination (or single Jansen dose). They have returned a negative PCR or lateral flow test result in the past 48 hours and reported it on the NHS website (this pass is valid for 48 hours after the result). They have had a positive PCR test result in the past six months and finished self-isolating (this pass lasts for 180 days). Those fans who are not fully vaccinated will be able to show proof of a recent negative lateral flow test instead of proof of vaccination. What happens if fans do not comply? Fans who fail to provide proof of double vaccination or proof of a negative lateral flow test will not be allowed access to the stadium. Will fans need to wear masks? As every single Premier League stadium is classed as an outdoor venue, along with those of all other professional football clubs in England, Wales and Scotland, wearing a mask will not be required when 'plan B' comes into effect. Image: Fans are not obligated to wear masks at large sporting events Will clubs really be able to police it? Premier League clubs hold regular discussions about what future measures might be required and have been working towards this scenario for several months, according to Sky Sports News. The new measures place a lot of responsibility on the fans, who will be expected to arrive at the stadium with readily accessible Covid passes or confirmation of negative lateral flow test result on email or text message. Clubs are still waiting for finer details about the impact of the new measures, in terms of how they can ensure verification, but some, such as Tottenham, Chelsea and Brighton have already made Covid passes mandatory while several others have been spot-checking supporters. At Brighton, stewards have been trained to check and understand what to look for on an NHS Covid pass and also recognise a valid lateral flow test result. The extra costs involved terms of time and stewarding manpower will be picked up by the individual clubs but those clubs have already prepared for the logistical challenges posed by the new rules. Will fans need to arrive earlier? While there is no official government advice regarding arrival times for fans, it may be necessary to be at the stadium earlier than usual given the verification process is likely to mean longer, slower-moving queues. Image: West Ham fans pictured at the London Stadium 'It will be difficult… but clubs are prepared' Sky Sports News reporter Kaveh Solhekol: \"Premier League clubs have been working very hard behind the scenes to prepare themselves for the possibility of the so-called vaccine passport being introduced. \"Logistically it is going to be difficult; you're going to need more stewards to check that everyone has a vaccination certificate, you're going to need to check that those who don't do have a negative lateral flow test. \"It's going to be more complicated but a lot of work has already been done - Premier League clubs have prepared for this. \"The advice has always been that if you've been going to Premier League matches this season, you should have proof of vaccination or a negative test in the previous 48 hours. \"The difference is from next Wednesday, if you're going to a Premier League or Championship game - games where there is going to be more than 10,000 people, you have to have proof of your certificate or a negative test - otherwise you won't be getting into the game.\" Could games go behind closed doors again? There are currently no plans in place to reduce crowd sizes and the hope is that the new measures will prevent the need for stricter regulations - especially given the financial implications on clubs. \"That is something that clubs definitely do not want to happen,\" added Solhekol. \"Last time that football closed down it ended up costing the clubs in England something like £2bn.\" Should vaccination be mandatory? Premier League managers have been giving their verdicts on the possibility of making vaccination mandatory. West Ham manager David Moyes: \"I know that people have a right to make their own choices and I respect that. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player West Ham manager David Moyes said he would support Covid passports being required for supporters to attend football matches, before the government later confirmed the introduction of such measures \"But I actually think it's something now which we would seriously have to consider because if I was a supporter, I really would want to go to a game next to someone who I knew had been vaccinated.\" Spurs boss Antonio Conte gave an emotional press conference on Wednesday afternoon, revealing the worsening situation had left everyone \"a bit scared\" and worried for their families. Fellow Italian coach Claudio Ranieri feels players should take up the offer of a vaccine but accepts it is a personal choice. \"I think the more important thing is all the players must be vaccinated, because we play every three days now and meet a lot of players,\" said the Watford boss. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Tottenham head coach Antonio Conte has questioned why his players and staff are being made to continue preparing for their upcoming matches after confirming 13 positive Covid-19 cases amid an outbreak at the club \"It is important, the vaccine, because if something happens with the vaccine it is very slow - without the vaccine, it is a big risk. \"I understand Conte and I hope here in Watford everything continues to be OK.\" Ranieri added: \"Of course I have to respect everybody, but they must know that we stay together and if they then come (with the virus), they can infect something, so then it is important that everybody must be vaccinated.\" The Italian does not know how many of his Watford squad have been vaccinated, but is confident the club's own Covid-19 protocols are robust. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Watford head coach Claudio Ranieri says players 'must be vaccinated' against coronavirus and reveals the club will not have a Christmas party this year \"We have to continue in this way, it is very important to maintain the correct distance and make a Covid test every two days and go with a mask,\" Ranieri said. Malcolm Clarke, chair of the FSA, said: \"From the earliest days of the pandemic we have always said that supporters should follow the expert advice of medical professionals and scientists. \"If those experts feel that public health is best-served by the introduction of vaccine passports or lateral flow tests for all large outdoor events, then we accept that requirement. \"We'd encourage clubs to work with local fan groups to ensure that any new procedures run smoothly and those with genuine medical exemptions are supported.\"\n",

Article content “The effectiveness of vaccines for Canadians living with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases has not been thoroughly investigated before, primarily due to them being excluded from COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials,” said Dr. Jessica Widdifield, lead author of the study and a scientist at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre. “Our encouraging findings begin to give a clearer picture of vaccine effectiveness in those with IMIDs.” The study, published in The Lancet Rheumatology, found mRNA vaccines were 92 to 97 per cent effective against hospitalization or death due to COVID for people with IMIDs. Even though the immunity waned over time, vaccination remained effective even beyond 120 days after a second dose. Immunity also rebounded after a booster shot.

While BA.4 is making its way to other countries, BA.5 has been slower to leave South Africa and Botswana.

Article content The World Health Organization last month added the two subvariants to its monitoring list, but said it was tracking just a few dozen cases globally. The two new sublineages can dodge antibodies from earlier infection well enough to trigger a new wave, but are far less able to thrive in the blood of people vaccinated against COVID-19, South African scientists found. “What we are seeing now, or at least maybe the first signs, is not completely new variants emerging, but current variants are starting to create lineages of themselves,” Tulio de Oliveira, director of the KwaZulu-Natal Research and Innovation Sequencing Platform (KRISP), told the New York Times. Omicron has produced several subvariants since it was identified in South Africa and neighbouring Botswana in November.

The provincial government had previously only made Pfizer vaccines available to that age group, even thought Health Canada had approved vaccines by both Pfizer and Moderna. Ontario’s Ministry of Health says Pfizer is the preferred vaccine, but has updated its guidance to say that Moderna can also be given on the basis of informed consent. The change comes after an Ottawa professor filed a human rights complaint against Ottawa Public Health in order to get access to Moderna vaccines for his children.

WTO director-general Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, who has made vaccine equity her top priority since taking office in 2021, has been working for months to broker a compromise between the United States, the European Union, India and South Africa to break an 18-month-long impasse. “What the discussions were aiming at was coming up with something workable,” Okonjo-Iweala told Reuters, saying she hoped the WTO’s 164 members would finalize and approve the proposal by a major conference in June. “This will advance the discussion and dialog.

They studied nearly 62,000 U.S. children with asthma who had PCR tests for the virus in the first year of the pandemic, including more than 7,700 who tested positive. Infected children had significantly more asthma visits, hospitalizations, emergency inhaler use, and steroid treatments during the six months after their illness compared to children who tested negative and to their own prior history, researchers reported in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice. Children who tested negative for the virus “had improved asthma control for the next six months, meaning fewer emergency department visits and hospitalizations for asthma, and less asthma treatment,” said Dr. Christine Chou of Children’s Health of Orange County, in California.

Article content Results of earlier studies showing improvement in asthma control in the early part of the pandemic were likely due to public health measures like staying home and masking, which curbed exposure to asthma triggers, she said. Despite the overall impression that children with asthma did well during the first year of the pandemic, Chou added, the new study shows “longer lasting harm of COVID on children’s asthma control.” — Reuters Booster after infection adds little extra benefit vs Omicron Among people who were previously infected with the coronavirus, a third dose of an mRNA vaccine from Pfizer /BioNTech or Moderna may not boost their protection against the Omicron variant of the virus, according to new data.

Article content Researchers studied nearly 130,000 people tested for COVID in Connecticut from November 2021 through January 2022, including 10,676 with Omicron infections. Roughly 6-8 per cent had been infected with previous versions of the coronavirus, according to a report posted on medRxiv ahead of peer review. Two doses of an mRNA vaccine did help protect against Omicron among people with prior infections, but “we did not detect an additional benefit of receiving a third booster dose among this population,” said Margaret Lind of Yale University. A separate Canadian study, also posted on medRxiv ahead of peer review, similarly found that more than two vaccine doses “may be of marginal incremental value” for protecting previously-infected individuals against Omicron.

Article content The message, Lind said, “should be that (1) people should get two doses of mRNA vaccine regardless of if they have had a prior infection or not, that (2) people without prior infections should get a booster dose and that (3) people with prior infections should consider a booster dose, especially if they are in a high risk group for life threatening complications, but recognize that it may not provide significant additional protection against infection above two doses.” — Reuters New Zealand further eases COVID measures, opens borders to 60 more countries New Zealand welcomed thousands of travellers from around the globe on Monday as the country opened its borders to visitors from around 60 nations including Canada, the United States, Britain and Singapore for the first time since COVID-19 hit in early 2020.

Tough coronavirus curbs in Shanghai have stirred rare public anger, with millions of the city’s 25 million people stuck indoors for more than a month, some sealed inside fenced-off residential compounds and many struggling for daily necessities. While Shanghai officials said the situation is improving, images on social media have unnerved the public at a time when hospitals and mortuaries in the city are overwhelmed.

      "The government will not change the six-month gap between second doses of the coronavirus vaccine and the booster jab unless the UK's vaccine advisory body recommends it, a health minister has said. Care minister Gillian Keegan told Kay Burley on Sky News that ministers will \"do whatever\" the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) says when it comes to booster jab rules, and that the advisory body is \"continually looking at the data\". Her comments come amid concerns that the pace of the booster vaccine rollout is too slow, with former health secretary and Conservative MP Jeremy Hunt suggesting the gap should be cut to five months to improve immunity in the lead up to Christmas. Image: Margaret Keenan was the first person to receive her booster jab in September In the latest data released on Thursday, the UK recorded another 52,009 new COVID cases and 115 virus-related deaths. The number of new infections marked the first time that figure had been above 50,000 since 17 July. Advertisement Live updates on COVID from the UK and around the world Back in September, the government said those aged over 50, people who live and work in care homes, frontline health and social care workers, people aged over 16 with health conditions putting them at serious risk to COVID-19 or infections and those over 16 who are a main carer for someone at high risk from coronavirus should get a booster jab. At present, only those who received their second coronavirus vaccine dose at least six months ago are being asked to come forward. Asked if this timeframe could be reduced, Ms Keegan told Sky News: \"Well the JCVI are the only people who can answer that question. \"So what happens is the JCVI obviously look at all the data, they look at loads of different things, and they basically make trade offs and advise us. Image: Former health secretary Jeremy Hunt has suggested the gap between second doses and booster doses should be cut to five weeks \"So they have advised us six months. We put that plan in place from 14 September, the first booster jab went in the arm on 16 September. \"And of course they are continually looking at the data - but they are the only people who can really answer this question. \"But if they advise us, our job then is to get ready, obviously, to do whatever they say so. \"But at the moment it is six months, that is what we have been told and that plan is in place and has been in place for about five weeks now.\" Speaking to reporters on a visit to a vaccine centre on Friday, the PM said \"the key message for today is for all people, over 50s, think about getting your booster jab\". Image: Boris Johnson said the key message is for people to get their boosters He added that a question about reducing the length of time between second jab and booster from six months to five months was an \"important\" one, adding that \"a lot of people\" are looking at the issue. \"I think that people should be coming forward with the same spirit of determination to get their boosters as we saw earlier on this year,\" Mr Johnson said. \"It's a very good thing to do. It gets you a huge amount of protection and we always expected that we would see numbers rise right about now. That is happening. \"And you've also got to take into account the waning effectiveness of the first two jabs. So get your boosters now.\" Pressed on calls from those including fellow Conservative MP and chairman of the Commons Health and Social Care Committee Mr Hunt that the timeframe between second coronavirus jabs and booster doses should be reduced as infections continue to rise, Ms Keegan said \"there is a lot of people who have opinions\". Concerns have been raised after many eligible people have reported not getting an invite for their booster jab, while others who have got one said they have been told to call their local health centres and have struggled to get through. Image: In September, the government's scientific advisers recommended that everyone over 50 should be offered a third dose of a COVID vaccine, along with frontline medical staff and younger adults with some underlying health conditions But speaking to Sky News on Thursday, Health minister Edward Argar told Sky News' Kay Burley: \"We've got the capacity to do it, we've got the vaccine, over 2,500 venues where people can be jabbed across the country. \"Part of it is encouraging people to take up the jab and we've now made a change. \"It's not just about waiting to be invited, if you get to the six month plus one week get on the national booking system and book yourself in.\" The latest figures show 49,554,407 people have had at least one jab and a total of 45,460,122 people are fully vaccinated. Speaking on Thursday, the PM admitted the level of COVID cases is \"high\" and said he is \"watching the numbers very carefully every day\". However, the PM has insisted he is \"sticking with our plan\". Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 1:31 Boris Johnson was asked about coronavirus at a school in Northern Ireland on Thursday The government has so far resisted calls to move to Plan B of its autumn and winter COVID response for easing pressures on the NHS. The NHS Confederation and the British Medical Association (BMA) has called on the government to implement Plan B now, with BMA council chair Dr Chaand Nagpaul claiming the government has \"taken its foot off the brake\". Under Plan B: • The public would be told \"clearly and urgently\" about the need to exercise caution to help control the virus • Legally mandated coverings would return in some settings and the work from home mandate could be re-introduced • The government also has the option of making COVID vaccine certificates mandatory in certain scenarios Shadow work and pensions secretary Jonathan Reynolds told Sky News on Friday that masks \"should always have been part of the plan\" and accused the government if being \"complacent \" in dealing with rising cases of COVID. Health Secretary Sajid Javid has predicted there could be as many as 100,000 COVID cases a day heading into winter. But the government has insisted its priority is rolling out the coronavirus vaccine and the booster jab programme to all those eligible. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 0:56 Sajid Javid said on Thursday that there is no need for 'Plan B' yet Speaking at a Downing Street news briefing on Wednesday, Mr Javid appeared to imply people were simply not taking up the booster offer. He told a news conference: \"If we want to secure these freedoms for the long-term than the best thing we can do is come forward once again when that moment comes. \"After the decisive steps that we've taken this year, none of us want to go backwards now. \"If we all play our part, then we can give ourselves the best possible chance in this race, get through this winter, and enjoy Christmas with our loved ones.\" Speaking to reporters on Friday, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss added: \"Well what the difference is this year versus last year is, because we have had the vaccine, the rates of hospitalisation and deaths are much, much lower than they were last year. \"So it is right that we continue to keep things under review, but of course it is important that people are able to make their own decisions given that we have seen a dramatic drop in the rates of hospitalisation.\"\n",

Photo: iStock There's nothing wrong with wanting to go to Italy, or to visit France. These are two of the world's most popular tourist destinations for a reason – they're incredible countries, and probably the two that first come to mind when you picture the beauty and the cultural splendour of a European holiday. However, there is more to the Continent than the big-name destinations. Europe might be popular, but it is still filled with unexplored nooks and crannies, entire countries that rarely make it onto visitors' itineraries, nations that are either just gaining traction as destinations or have always managed to fly under the radar. See Also Europe travel guide As we emerge from our pandemic-enforced cocoons, it's now more important than ever to look to a few of these lesser-known nations and plan a visit, to break free of the urge to simply return to places we already know. It's time to feel the thrill of exploration once again, to visit some of Europe's small players and discover everything they have to offer. If you're looking to break new ground on your next European visit, these are the countries to consider. INSTEAD OF SICILY CONSIDER MALTA Gozo island, Malta. Photo: iStock WHY GO Here's a Mediterranean island that's tiny – a fraction of the size of somewhere like Sicily – yet it packs a serious punch in terms of experiences offered. It's a little Italian, a little Arabian, and also entirely unique. It also has very few COVID-19 cases now. SEE + DO Malta has history, it has culture, it has landscapes to swoon over. It's probably best known for its towering limestone cliffs and gorgeous beaches and bays, but the island also has hilltop fortress towns such as Mdina and Victoria, an entire separate island, Gozo, where time has stood still, and an incredible capital city. DON'T MISS That capital, Valletta, is a microcosm of everything that is good here, a city built by the Knights of St John, a World Heritage site filled with historical attractions, plus the chance to sample Maltese cuisine, with its influences from Europe and the Arab world. ESSENTIALS Vaccinated Australians can enter Malta without prior testing, and there is no quarantine. Australian vaccination certificates are accepted on entry and within the country. Face masks are mandatory in both indoor and outdoor areas. See visitmalta.com INSTEAD OF CROATIA CONSIDER ALBANIA Dhermi Beach, Albania. Photo: iStock Advertisement WHY GO Albania might just be one of Europe's most exciting new destinations, a coastal locale that was closed to visitors for much of the 20th century, but is now very much up for discovery. A winter COVID-19 wave here has now very much dissipated. SEE + DO Albania shares a coastline with Croatia, so you can imagine that's a big drawcard here – there is, in fact, an \"Albanian Riviera\", a stretch of resort towns, many that are historic attractions in their own right, providing access to white-sand beaches and clear waters. Check out Ksamil in the south, or Bunec. DON'T MISS The best place to get a feel for Albania's recent past and its exciting future is the capital, Tirana, where you'll find some top-quality museums and galleries, including Bunk'Art, a huge Cold War bunker that has been turned into a modern art space. ESSENTIALS Travellers will need to either be vaccinated or take a PCR test before entering Albania. A nationwide curfew is in place from 11pm to 6am, and face masks must be worn in all indoor areas. See albania.al INSTEAD OF THE NETHERLANDS CONSIDER BELGIUM Brussels has a great bar and restaurant scene. Photo: iStock WHY GO Poor Belgium. Everyone knows it's there, and they might even skip across to Bruges for a few hours to tick the box, but how many actually take the time to properly explore? This is a wonderful country with plenty to offer, and one that is through its major Omicron wave. SEE + DO Bruges is great, of course, but consider Brussels, with its great bar and restaurant scene (try the mussels and chips), Antwerp for its fashion, Ghent for its history, and the Trappist monasteries for their incredible beer. DON'T MISS Why not stay in one of those monasteries? Westmalle Abbey, outside Antwerp, offers rooms for \"anyone who experiences silence and calm as beneficial\". Though its brewery is closed to visitors, the abbey is surrounded by bars that serve its beer. See trappistwestmalle.be ESSENTIALS Visitors from Australia must be fully vaccinated and take a PCR test or RAT before flying. Australian vaccination certificates can be used to obtain a 31-day \"COVID SafeTicket\" for use in Belgium. See belgium.be INSTEAD OF FRANCE CONSIDER BULGARIA Ski resort town Bansko. Photo: iStock WHY GO This isn't a like-for-like arrangement – the experience of visiting Bulgaria is far different to France. What Bulgaria does offer, however, for those for whom France means alpine splendour, is mountains. There are ski resorts such as Bansko and Borovets that offer serious value for money in a country with a low COVID-19 caseload. SEE + DO In winter, those ski resorts are going to be a big draw. Borovets is the family-friendly mountain, with gentle slopes and ski-in ski-out accommodation, whereas Bansko is justifiably famous for its apres-ski scene. DON'T MISS Outside the ski scene, the Bulgarian capital, Sofia, has a lot to offer, including a mix of domed churches and Ottoman-era mosques, plus Roman ruins, and a youthful, exciting restaurant and bar scene. ESSENTIALS Face masks are compulsory indoors in Bulgaria. Australians will need to carry paper copies of their vaccine certificates to enter certain facilities. Entry to the country is currently tricky for Australians, though a decision on COVID-19 vaccination certificate equivalence is expected soon. See bulgariatravel.org INSTEAD OF ITALY CONSIDER SLOVENIA Slovenia is paradise for outdoors enthusiasts. Photo: iStock WHY GO Just google Slovenia and go to the images page and you will immediately understand. This is one stupendously beautiful country, all high mountains and shimmering lakes, fairytale villages and medieval cities. SEE + DO Slovenia is paradise for outdoors enthusiasts, who have their pick of hiking trails in the mountains, cycling tracks both on-road and off, plus caving, canyoning, rafting… All those fun things. This is a cultural destination too, with influence of past empires such as the Venetians and Habsburgs. DON'T MISS During that image search you will no doubt see the gorgeous visage of Lake Bled, the geographical jewel in Slovenia's crown, where a tiny Baroque chapel has become the stuff of every wannabe Instagram star's dreams. ESSENTIALS There are no testing or vaccine requirements for Australians entering Slovenia. Face masks are required in certain settings, and travellers should carry a hard copy of their vaccination certificate. See slovenia.info INSTEAD OF DENMARK CONSIDER NORWAY The aurora borealis seen from the Lofoten Islands, Norway. Photo: iStock WHY GO If these post-pandemic days have you yearning for isolation and for natural beauty mixed with the high level of organisation and modern facilities that Scandinavia can reliably provide, then we have just the country for you: Norway, home of astounding natural beauty, not many people, and rapidly dropping COVID-19 numbers. SEE + DO Obviously you want to get away, you want to see the fiords, you want to skirt the Arctic Circle, you want to climb a mountain and perch atop a cliff. All doable here. Scandinavia, however, is becoming known for its food, and in Norway you will find an extension of this new Nordic scene, with a heavy emphasis on seafood. DON'T MISS Travellers make pilgrimages to Copenhagen to eat at gastronomic temples such as Noma and Geranium, but don't forget Maaemo, a three-Michelin-starred fine-diner in Oslo that uses organic, biodynamic and wild food to create something incredible. See maaemo.no ESSENTIALS All travel restrictions for Norway have been lifted, meaning Australians are free to come and go as they please – you'll only need proof of vaccination (or a negative PCR test) to visit Svalbard. See visitnorway.com INSTEAD OF SPAIN CONSIDER ANDORRA A traditional bar in Andorra. Photo: Getty Images WHY GO Squeezed into a section of the Pyrenees between Spain and France, Andorra is a sky-high principality that is big on natural beauty, a place to ski in winter, hike in summer, and enjoy Catalan-style culture year-round. SEE + DO In terms of ski resorts, Vallnord and Grandvalira are the two main areas, and offer high-quality terrain – though they're not exactly cheap. It's worth visiting in summer, however, to stroll the pretty capital, Andorra la Vella, see its many churches, and dine at its rustic Catalan restaurants. DON'T MISS Strap on your hiking boots and get ready to tackle the mountainous terrain. Perhaps best is the climb to the top of Andorra's highest peak, Pic de Coma Pedrosa, a five-hour walk with stunning views and a hut for accommodation halfway along. ESSENTIALS Good news: there are no entry requirements for Andorra. If you've made it into Spain or France, then you will be allowed into Andorra. Masks are mandatory in enclosed public spaces; carry a hard copy of your vaccination certificate. See visitandorra.com INSTEAD OF GREECE CONSIDER NORTH MACEDONIA Jovan Kaneo church in Ohrid. Photo: iStock WHY GO The country formerly known as the Republic of Macedonia is a nation very much in touch with its roots, a rustic and real destination where you can experience the heritage of the Greeks, Romans, Ottomans and more, plus check out some serious natural beauty. COVID-19 cases are also at their lowest since August last year. SEE + DO The cultural and historical attractions of North Macedonia are well worth experiencing: see the medieval monasteries of Prilep, the old Turkish market and Ottoman mosques of Stip, the traditional houses of Krusevo, and the Byzantine landmarks of the capital, Skopje. DON'T MISS The true highlight of North Macedonia is unquestionably Ohrid, a World Heritage site filled with incredible churches, bazaars, fortresses and ancient archaeological sites. ESSENTIALS Australians will need proof of full vaccination to enter North Macedonia, plus you will need the certificate to enter many restaurants and cultural venues. Masks are required on public transport and in indoor areas. See macedonia-timeless.com INSTEAD OF GERMANY CONSIDER LUXEMBOURG The Grund district. Photo: iStock WHY GO This tiny city-state might be known more as a haven for tax-shy expats than as a serious tourist destination, but it actually has a lot going for it on a short stay, including a heritage-listed capital, a thriving wine industry, and a surprising amount of natural beauty. SEE + DO Begin in the country's largest city – its only city, in fact – with a tour of Luxembourg's heritage-listed Ville Haute, or high city, to see its cathedral, its palace, its abbey and more. Outside the city, find a medieval castle in Vianden, a 12th-century castle in Clervaux, and a World War II museum in Diekirch. DON'T MISS Be sure to sample the wine in Luxembourg. It's made along the Moselle river near the town of Remich, with plenty of bars in town and wineries within hiking distance outside it. ESSENTIALS Australian vaccination certificates are currently not recognised in Luxembourg, which means a PCR test will be necessary before entering – though if you're coming in by road, there are no checks. Australians will be restricted from visiting local hospitals, elderly homes and other care facilities. See visitluxembourg.com INSTEAD OF TURKEY CONSIDER BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA Mostar, Bosnia and Herzegovina. Photo: iStock WHY GO Part Ottoman, part Austro-Hungarian, part Slavic; part warm and laidback, part deeply war-torn; part medieval, part modern – there's so much to take in in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The contrast and contradiction will keep you fascinated for a lifetime. COVID-19 cases here are also very low. SEE + DO The buzzing historical centres of Sarajevo and Mostar are without doubt the big drawcards here, with their Turkish-style architecture balanced with pumping restaurant and bar scenes; however, make sure to see amazing Kravica Waterfall, and Blagaj Tekke, a Dervish house at the mouth of a cave. DON'T MISS You can't leave Bosnia and Herzegovina without seeing Stari Most, a marvel of 16th-century engineering – though one that had to be recreated after the 1990s war – in Mostar, a gorgeous stone bridge surrounded by cafes and restaurants offering prime viewing opportunities. ESSENTIALS Australians have to present proof of vaccination – in hard copy – to enter Bosnia and Herzegovina. COVID-19 regulations vary throughout the country. See travel- bosnia.ba FIVE LESSER VISITED EUROPEAN REGIONS You might know these countries, but how well do you know some of their quieter corners? BASILICATA, ITALY Matera, Basilicata. Photo: iStock This rugged, mountainous region sits in the bridge of Italy's boot, Calabria on one side, Puglia on the other. It's probably best known for Matera, one of the oldest continuously inhabited settlements in the world – dating back to the Palaeolithic period. It's a city filled with \"sassi\", or ancient cave dwellings, many of which are still in use today. Elsewhere in Basilicata, the coastline is lined with rocky coves and clifftop villages. See basilicataturistica.it CASTILLA Y LEON, SPAIN The likes of Barcelona, Seville and even Madrid cast such long shadows that a region as historic and beautiful as Castilla y Leon can be almost lost – but that can be to your advantage. This vast area in Spain's north is home to Segovia, with its fairytale fortress; Avila and its towering medieval walls; Burgos, with its rich food culture, and Salamanca, lively and upbeat. And few tourists. See turismocastillayleon.com SAXONY, GERMANY Saxony doesn't feel like Germany, in many ways. It doesn't even feel like Western Europe. This vast area of the former East Germany, taking in Dresden, Leipzig and Gorlitz, is filled with baroque villages that would look more at home in neighbouring Czechia, though there's also plenty of artsy, modern culture in its larger centres. See germany.travel SCANIA, SWEDEN When travellers think of Sweden they tend to think of Stockholm, or perhaps the wilderness of Norrland, but don't forget Scania, the country's southernmost region, home to the likes of trendy Malmo, student-friendly Lund, and historic Eslov. This is an area with plenty of open space, plus a mix of Danish and Swedish culture. See scania.org ALENTEJO, PORTUGAL Portugal's fruit bowl, to the east of Lisbon, is a laidback and hugely enjoyable region, a place to live life in the slow lane, to eat good food and drink local wine and do very little else.

      "Northern Ireland’s politicians have agreed that face masks won’t be a necessary requirement when dancing in nightclubs once venues reopen on October 31. On Tuesday, the Executive published its Covid-19 contingency plan, which said face coverings in indoor areas will remain mandatory throughout the coming winter months. However, on Thursday Stormont ministers decided club-goers “will not need to wear face coverings while dancing” and the deputy first minister has also said plans to reopen nightclubs on Halloween night are still set to go ahead. Social distancing rules that currently limit capacity in bars and restaurants will additionally change from regulation to guidance. People will also be able to move freely around hospitality premises from October 31, including being able to stand at the bar for a drink, and people won’t be required to wear face masks in settings that involve drinking and eating. Read More Michelle O’Neill noted that the further easing of more restrictions is still intended for that date, but she added that the Executive will have to keep a \"cautious watch\" on Covid-19 cases in Northern Ireland. \"We continue to monitor the way in which transmission is spreading, but also the way in which it is spreading in hospitals,\" commented first minister, Paul Givan. He added that the new strand of the Delta variant of Covid-19, is \"not causing concern\" in Northern Ireland at this stage, despite a growing number of infections in the UK being caused by the descendant of the virus. \"We're continuing to monitor it; it is a transmissible variant more so than before - that's something we need to be alert to.\" Stormont ministers met on Thursday to assess recent health data ahead of next week’s reopening, and they were told that community transmission in Northern Ireland remains “roughly constant at a high level”. The update paper from health officials said Covid ICU numbers remain steady at between 30 to 40, while death rates remain low. Ministers were told that modelling suggests transmission is set to plateau at the current high level for the next six weeks, with the possibility of modest falls or rises in case numbers and hospital pressures.

Manage Preference The Executive has also outlined measures it will implement if coronavirus cases spike or if the pressure on hospitals becomes “unsustainable”. The use of Covid-19 vaccine passports in hospitality venues is one option being considered - a system already enabled in the Republic of Ireland. The Belfast Trust has already said that the Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children is under “extreme pressure” due to “children experiencing new respiratory symptoms and management of the Covid-19 pandemic”. A spokesperson said that the hospital has “been managing the early onset of winter pressures since August” which has been “compounded by the impact of Covid-19 and the availability of staff”, with many children’s surgeries being postponed. Dr Smith, a leading virologist from the University of Cambridge, told BBC Breakfast that around half of Covid cases are asymptomatic, and that the UK is probably already close to 100,000 new coronavirus cases per day. Northern Ireland's chief scientific adviser Prof Ian Young also said that Northern Ireland had reached \"a steady state with really quite high levels of Covid in the community\" of about 475 cases per 100,000 population per seven days. He stressed the importance of the booster vaccination programme throughout winter, with nearly 40,000 booster jabs having been rolled out in NI to date.\n",

Women were more likely than men to say they’ll keep wearing masks. Also more inclined to continue wearing masks: older and university-educated Quebecers, as well as people who lived in Greater Montreal. 1:10 p.m. As mask mandate nears end, Dubé urges Quebecers to respect those who continue to wear them With Quebec’s broad mask mandate about to end, Health Minister Christian Dubé today urged Quebecers to “respect those who wish to continue to take advantage of this means of protecting themselves effectively against COVID-19.” Advertisement 14 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content In a press release, Dubé noted that masks will remain compulsory in certain settings: “The obligation to wear a mask in public transport is maintained because of the difficulty passengers have in managing the distances between each other.” In health care institutions, “such as hospitals, medical clinics and CHSLDs, wearing a mask also remains mandatory, due to the high presence of vulnerable people, and because it is essential to protect staff, whose presence at work is particularly crucial in this time of health crisis.” In health care institutions, “such as hospitals, medical clinics and CHSLDs, wearing a mask also remains mandatory, due to the high presence of vulnerable people, and because it is essential to protect staff, whose presence at work is particularly crucial in this time of health crisis.” People who have had COVID-19 must wear a mask “during any social interaction following their isolation, i.e. at least five days following their isolation at home.” Quebecers living with someone who has COVID must wear masks in indoor settings for 10 days. Advertisement 15 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content Dubé noted that masks are still recommended for certain “vulnerable people and the elderly, especially those at risk of complications.” Others should wear a mask in the presence of these people in order to limit the risk of contagion, he added. “The evolution of the epidemiological situation, which is encouraging overall, allows us to partially lift” the mask mandate, Dubé said. Face coverings have “effectively contributed to the protection of Quebecers, and remain relevant in certain cases. Wearing the mask in the places concerned will now be a matter of individual choice. We invite citizens to remain responsible in their risk management and to show respect.” 12:10 p.m. Quebec will drop mandatory masks May 14 but some should keep wearing them, Boileau says Advertisement 16 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content Quebec will drop its mask mandate as of 12:01 a.m. on Saturday, May 14, but face coverings will continue to be mandatory on public transit and in health care settings and long-term care homes (CHSLDs). And the province will continue to recommend that certain Quebecers wear masks in all public places. The end of the broad mask mandate means students and teachers will not be required to wear masks in schools or on school buses. Quebec imposed the mask restriction on July 18, 2020 – 22 months ago. It’s the last pandemic measure in place in the province. Dr. Luc Boileau, the province’s interim public health director, announced the end of the mask mandate at a Quebec City press conference this morning. He said that in some situations, masks will still be recommended. That includes older people and others who are at high risk. Advertisement 17 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content “The whole portrait is improving,” Boileau said, citing declines in cases, hospitalizations and the number of health workers absent due to COVID. “We’re on the way to exiting the sixth wave but we must stay prudent because the pandemic isn’t over. In the coming weeks, (the virus) will continue to spread in the community – not as intensely but it will still be there.” When will Quebec drop the mask mandate on buses, subways and trains? Boileau said he will have an update in the coming days or weeks on that question, adding the plan is to drop mandatory masks on transit during the spring. Quebec is preparing for a “probable” seventh wave in the fall, Boileau said. He was asked if the province could re-introduce measures, including masks, if cases surge later this year. In response, he said the province’s intention is not to bring restrictions back. Advertisement 18 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content “We are not expecting to re-introduce any obligation for the wearing of the mask or any other measures,” Boileau said. “It depends on what’s going to happen. If it would be the same type (of subvariant) that we are facing right now… we do not expect to re-introduce any constraining measures… “We will certainly give recommendations to the (public and) to the government to adjust themselves but not necessarily to introduce constraining measures. But again it depends on what’s going to happen. Nobody knows what’s going to happen. “If anyone says they know what’s going to happen, don’t believe them.” Dr. Jean Longtin, a microbiologist with the public health department, said the question is when, not if, a seventh wave will happen in Quebec. Advertisement 19 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content “It would be very surprising if this wave was the last one,” he said. “We know this virus will most likely have a seasonal pattern. So all the ingredients are there to predict another wave in the fall, maybe another one also in the winter.” Longtin said the province’s response will depend on several factors, including which variant dominates and the extent of vaccine effectiveness and immunity from previous infections. A vaccination campaign will be necessary during the fall, but it’s unclear which segments of the population will need to be targeted, Longtin added.

The U.S. vaccine maker is developing a potential next-generation booster targeted at both the Omicron variant as well as the original strain of the coronavirus in hopes of producing broader protection. “The desired features for a northern hemisphere fall-winter booster we think will be that it improves the durability of neutralizing antibodies against Omicron,” said Moderna President Stephen Hoge. Hoge expects annual boosters to be needed for people at high-risk of severe illness, which Moderna estimates consists of roughly 1.7 billion people worldwide.

However, the ISQ found that the excess mortality rate in the United States is higher than that of Quebec, while that in the rest of Canada, while initially lower than Quebec, has progressively increased and surpassed it in 2021.

The study of 46 patients, who were assessed six to ten months after being hospitalized, showed slower and less accurate responses than what was expected for their age and demographic profile. Those patients who required ventilators and organ support scored even worse. The effect was sudden, as it was the equivalent of aging 20 years intellectually within the span of a few months. Advertisement 25 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content The impairment is equivalent to losing about 10 IQ points, said co-author Adam Hampshire, a professor of restorative neurosciences at Imperial College London, in an interview. He added that his team observed a very slow recovery among the case subjects if any at all. “That will have an impact on the person’s daily function, their ability to work and go on about their lives.” In England alone, over 40,000 COVID-19 survivors could encounter these cognitive difficulties, according to estimates by the research team. That’s a conservative estimate, Hampshire said. The study, which was published in the journal eClinicalMedicine, adds to a growing body of research that suggests that people who have recovered from COVID-19, including patients with milder symptoms, may struggle with cognitive functions like problem-solving and could have difficulties finding words or possibly suffer “brain fog.” Advertisement 26 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.

      "If installing yourself for half a day in front of a Bernini to appreciate the lifelikeness of marble, gaping with wonder at the frescoes of the Sistine Chapel, or losing yourself in Renoir’s Summer is your definition of an ideal vacation, you probably have more than one reason to anathematise COVID-19: for restricting global travel. Although parts of the world are opening up to tourists—and some already have—there are still too many restrictions to grapple with, including mandatory isolations, frequent COVID-19 tests, mandatory vaccination proof, etc., all of which have still managed to keep tourism subdued to a large extent. But thanks to technology, you don’t need to be in the US anymore to enjoy Cezanne’s Peppermint Bottle, or in Jerusalem to take in The Tree by the Bend (although that maybe have been ideal!). Google’s Arts and Culture app is a great way to explore art from around the world, from the safe confines of your hopefully well-sanitised home. Rated 4.3 out of 5 on the Google Play Store, with over 10 million downloads, the Google Arts & Culture app enables you to interact with art like you would in real life via augmented reality, peppering in a lot of interesting information that makes the experience more enjoyable than “some physical guided tours”, as per one review on the app’s Google Play Store listing page. The app is available on both Android and iOS, as well as on the desktop, although the AR experience is not accessible on the web browser. Up, close, and personal Google Arts & Culture lets you do a lot of things on a single platform, including some fun games and activities. You could either just click around on the homepage, or, if you’re a meticulous organiser like me and prefer symmetry, the offerings on the app can be broken down into the following ways: Paintings The app helps you discover new paintings, including some rarer pieces by famous artists, eras of painting, and landmark pieces from that era, new artists, etc. Every day or so, the app picks a new relevant topic pertaining to paintings, such as the Renaissance art period, or post-modern art, and throws up a wealth of information pertaining to that theme— so you can learn about art movements, cultural epochs, famous painters who adopted certain styles, and also how all of those things affected the microcosms around it. Stay Updated Get stories of change makers and innovators from the startup ecosystem in your inbox Please fill in this field. {{#error}} {{error}} {{/error}} {{^error}} Something went wrong. Try again later {{/error}} Welcome Onboard ! You have been successfully registered for our daily newsletter. Using augmented reality, you can project thousands of art pieces onto the walls of your home, and, thanks to Google’s excellent high-res image collection, even walk up to the painting to see minute details such as brush strokes. (I admittedly fondled my wall once because the AR looked so realistic, I thought I could actually touch the painting—the image quality is sublimely crip to the point of looking 3D-ish). You can discover paintings as per your favourite colour and even star signs. Galleries This is just a brilliant way to armchair travel to some of the world’s most prominent art galleries for free, including the Museum of Modern Art in New York, the Musée d'Orsay in Paris, which contains a lot of Van Gogh’s works, and the Uffizi Galleries in Florence, famous for its renaissance paintings, among several other prominent and frequently visited ones. Each gallery page tells you the most famous pieces you could come across in the museum, as well as extremely interesting stories behind some of the paintings—almost as if you were walking around with an art historian in real life (who, by the way, from personal experience, can cost nearly €250 per hour for a tour that lasts nearly three hours). Where Google Arts & Culture truly blows you away, reigniting a childlike wonder is when it lets you step inside a gallery from your home, like a Google Street View but for art galleries! Some of them are real-world galleries, while others are curated virtual reality experiences, such as an exhibition comprising all of Kandinsky’s works, or the ‘Brushes with the World’ gallery where you can do a virtual walking tour of an art gallery that contains paintings depicting different parts of the world, along with audio commentary and background music that play as you “step” closer to an art piece. Places and architecture The app allows one to virtually tour various must-see landmarks of the world such as the Taj Mahal, the Great Pyramid of Giza, Kyoto’s most celebrated temple, the Kiyomizu-dera, and Rome’s Colosseum, among many others, without throngs pushing and pulling you in different directions. You can also do really cool things like step inside Nina Simone’s childhood home in Washington DC, or walk the stage at Paris’ Opera Garnier, stepping into the shoes of a performer looking out at the 1,979 seats. And when the offerings of planet Earth fail to hold your attention, you can step inside the International Space Station or tunnel your way through CERN’s large hadron collider. Interactive This is what you can do beyond the aforementioned three categories, and it includes several things: Pottery: You can learn about all kinds of pottery-related topics, such as Greek pottery, Italian ceramics, etc. There’s also a really cool game you can play to create your own virtual pots based on famous designs. Music: Discover new artists, and learn about the history of music and some of its most noted movements, such as jazz and classical. A game that lets you compose melodies with the help of maestro composers such as Bach, Mozart, and Beethoven using machine learning will, in equal measure, delight and give you an ego boost (who doesn’t dream of playing with the greatest pianists and composers in the world on a daily basis?). Games and quizzes about paintings, music, architecture, etc. Discovering fashion, virtually visiting botanical gardens, learning about indigenous flora and fauna of a particular region, discovering chairs, puppets, and rings of different eras and countries. The verdict This app is a must-download for art aficionados and anyone interested in learning about our world a little better. There’s just so much information that every time you use the app, you come away feeling you’ve earned a doctorate in a particular painting, artist, architecture, or gallery. Where Google Arts & Culture shines is the degree of immersiveness it offers–it doesn’t feel like information overload at all because you’re constantly moving around an art gallery, for example, or watching a video about one small part of a multi-faceted sculpture. The discovery feature is an eye-opener, truly, and it introduces you to some of the most inane things about culture. I recently stumbled upon a whole unit on Manga, which, shamefully, after recently binge-watching Naruto, I knew little about. The unit not only talks about the history of Manga, but also lets you create your own Manga characters, discover museums where the artform was birthed, and even learn to create “music” in a Manga (for the uninitiated, Manga is a popular form of Japanese comics. It is largely hand-drawn.) There’s a beautifully illustrated story about how Osamu Tezuka, a legendary Manga artist, collaborated with artificial intelligence to create a comic, and, as someone who enjoys tech, it left a deep impression on me. The AR and VR features are extremely captivating, and it’s hard to not spend hours being a virtual art appraiser. “Love this app! The imagery is stunning. For example, the 3D view of artefacts is so detailed that you can literally see the texture as if you're physically in the museum browsing these works of art,” says one reviewer of the app—a sentiment vehemently echoed by millions of people in the review section. While nothing can truly replace the experience of physically visiting seeing a Matisse, a Munch or a Magritte in person, the Google Arts & Culture app comes within inches of it. Be warned though—for the genuinely interested, it’s an addictive app.\n",

      "Spectators will be required to show proof of double vaccination against Covid-19 or a negative lateral flow test to attend sporting events with crowds of more than 10,000 people after MPs approved government plans. The proposals were part of the government's 'plan B' to tackle the rise in Covid-19 cases caused by the Omicron variant, and were voted into force in the House of Commons on Tuesday evening by a majority of 243. Sky Sports News understands Premier League clubs - whose average attendances all exceed 10,000 - have been preparing for this eventuality. Some of the 20 top-flight sides - including Chelsea, Tottenham and Brighton - already made Covid passes mandatory for fans attending their home games earlier this season. Under the new rules, fans who are unable to prove they are double vaccinated or have produced a negative lateral flow test within 48 hours of the event will be denied entry. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Wolves head coach Bruno Lage reveals the club's players and coaching staff are all fully vaccinated against coronavirus However, as stadiums of all professional clubs in England, Scotland and Wales are classed as outdoor venues, supporters are still not required to wear masks in their seats. National rises in Covid cases have had an impact on the Premier League, which approved Manchester United's request to postpone their fixture at Brentford on Tuesday night. United were forced to shut down first-team operations at their Carrington training complex after recording a \"small number\" of positive results following Saturday's 1-0 win at Norwich. Tottenham have also had fixtures against Brighton and Rennes postponed this month, while the Premier League announced 42 new Covid cases among first-team players and staff between Monday, December 6 and Sunday, December 12 - the highest weekly number since figures were made public. According to the PA news agency, Premier League players and staff will now have to take a lateral flow test every time they want to enter their club's training ground. Twitter Due to your consent preferences, you’re not able to view this. Open Privacy Options Individuals will be required to take a lateral flow test outside the facility, while twice-weekly PCR testing is also being introduced. The decision on increased testing was taken at a clubs' shareholders' meeting on Tuesday, and will sit alongside existing emergency measures around face coverings, limiting time in the treatment room and observing social distancing which were reintroduced last week. What does it mean for me? To attend a Premier League game, you must now either show proof of double vaccination via the NHS Covid app, or proof of a negative lateral flow test taken inside the previous 48 hours. The rules are intended to \"[help] keep these events and venues open at full capacity while giving everyone who attends them confidence that those around them have done the responsible thing to minimise risk to others,\" Boris Johnson, the Prime Minister, said earlier this month. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Brighton chief executive Paul Barber is concerned rising cases of Covid-19 could lead to the return of empty stadiums at Premier League grounds How do I get a Covid pass? Fans can get a domestic Covid pass via the NHS Covid app if they are 18 or over, registered with a GP, and meet any of the following criteria: It has been at least two weeks since their second vaccination (or single Jansen dose). They have returned a negative PCR or lateral flow test result in the past 48 hours and reported it on the NHS website (this pass is valid for 48 hours after the result). They have had a positive PCR test result in the past six months and finished self-isolating (this pass lasts for 180 days). Those fans who are not fully vaccinated will be able to show proof of a recent negative lateral flow test instead of proof of vaccination.

As every single Premier League stadium is classed as an outdoor venue, along with those of all other professional football clubs in England, Wales and Scotland, wearing a mask will not be required. Will clubs really be able to police it? Premier League clubs hold regular discussions about what future measures might be required and have been working towards this scenario for several months, according to Sky Sports News. The new measures place a lot of responsibility on the fans, who will be expected to arrive at the stadium with readily accessible Covid passes or confirmation of a negative lateral flow test result on email or text message. Clubs are still waiting for finer details about the impact of the new measures in terms of how they can ensure verification, but some - such as Tottenham, Chelsea and Brighton - have already made Covid passes mandatory while several others have been spot-checking supporters. At Brighton, stewards have been trained to check and understand what to look for on an NHS Covid pass and also recognise a valid lateral flow test result. The extra costs involved in terms of time and stewarding manpower will be picked up by the individual clubs but those clubs have already prepared for the logistical challenges posed by the new rules. Will fans need to arrive earlier? While there is no official government advice regarding arrival times for fans, it may be necessary to be at the stadium earlier than usual given the verification process is likely to mean longer, slower-moving queues.\n",

Supreme Court lawsuit names 11 individuals who are challenging orders issued by provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry. They are being represented by the Justice Centre for Constitutional Freedoms, a legal advocacy group based in Alberta. The purpose of Henry’s orders was to protect patients from being infected with the COVID virus by unvaccinated health professionals, as well as to minimize the number of people being hospitalized or dying because of the virus. But the centre is arguing that the health mandates violate their clients’ Charter rights, and they want the orders declared null and void. “The position of the Justice Centre is that we recognize that vulnerable populations have to be protected, but the orders go too far because many of our petitioners do not even work with vulnerable populations,” said Karen Bastow, one of the lawyers on the case.

There is an unfairness here between the rules that had been applied under the regulated health professions and our petitioners, who are for the most part non-union.” Charlene Le Beau, another lawyer for the petitioners, said that it is clear that the vast majority of Canadians and health-care workers have been willing to take the vaccine. “But our petitioners, for justified and valid reasons — reasons that have been recognized in the context of vaccination mandates in other workplaces in Canada and around the world — don’t wish to take the vaccine,” said Le Beau. Phyllis Janet Tatlock, one of the 11 petitioners, was a director of operations at the B.C. Cancer Agency, which is part of the Provincial Health Services Authority.

      "Some European countries are seeing a resurgence in COVID-19, with the continent's eastern nations hampered by widespread vaccine hesitancy. Polls show that trust in state institutions and public healthcare is much lower in eastern Europe than it is across the rest of the continent, something that has been blamed for the low vaccination rates. At least one person in every three does not trust the healthcare system in eastern Europe, compared to an EU average of 18%, according to the European Commission. And when it comes to vaccine uptake, the European states with the lowest rates - Bulgaria, Romania, Poland and Latvia - are all part of the former communist bloc. Image: The German health minister said the pandemic state of emergency can end on 25 November • Romania had the highest death rate per capita in the world this week and the number of new cases soared towards 19,000, but only 36% of adults are vaccinated, about half the EU rate. Distrust in public healthcare is put at 40% Advertisement • Russia's government announced workplaces will close from 30 October to 7 November after Thursday saw 1,036 deaths and 36,339 new infections - both record daily highs. Despite being quick to produce its Sputnik vaccine earlier in the pandemic, many Russians have refused it - only 48 million of a population of 144 million were fully-vaccinated as of mid-October • In Bulgaria only one adult in four is fully-vaccinated. The number of people being admitted to hospital due to the virus has risen 30% in the past month, and hospitals in Sofia have halted non-essential surgeries • Latvia has gone back into lockdown for a month. A study by SKDS has found that among Latvia's Russian-speaking population (who account for about a third of the overall population), only 46% are vaccinated, compared with 62% among ethnic Latvians Image: This young man is among around 25% of adults in Bulgaria who are fully vaccinated • Poland (52% vaccinated) reported more than 5,000 new cases on Wednesday - the highest number since May - prompting the health minister to warn that drastic measures could be necessary. Vaccine uptake is particularly low in conservative areas, leaving the government with extra vaccine doses it has donated or sold abroad • Slovakia (41% vaccinated) reported its highest daily case numbers on Tuesday since 9 March and in the Czech Republic (56% vaccinated) the number of new cases passed 3,000 for the first time since April The situation differs in western Europe, where vaccination rates are generally higher and restrictions are being weakened alongside the introduction of vaccination passes in some parts. • In France, new cases jumped to 6,127, up 18% compared to a week earlier, having already risen by 8% on Wednesday. The country also registered 37 new deaths on Thursday, taking the total to 117,389. About two-thirds of people are fully-vaccinated • Italy (71% vaccinated) reported 36 deaths on Thursday (up from 33 the day before) with 3,794 new infections (up from 3,702) Image: Latvia has gone back into lockdown due to an increase in the number of COVID-19 cases • Germany reported just over 17,000 new infections on Wednesday compared to 11,903 a week ago, with its 92 deaths similar to the same day last week. Roughly two-thirds of people are fully-vaccinated. Health Minister Jens Spahn has said the pandemic state of emergency can end on 25 November, although some measures should continue • Portugal began the year with one of the highest rates of infection in the world but, with 85% fully vaccinated, it is turning things around. Masks are still widely worn and trust in state institutions is generally high. On Wednesday, 927 new cases were reported (up from 828 a week earlier). There were three deaths (down from nine a week earlier) • Spain reported 2,528 new cases on Wednesday (down from 2,758 a week earlier).

Kimmich missed the 2-1 defeat to Augsburg after having to isolate because of coming into contact with someone who was positive.

I follow all hygiene measures and get tested every two to three days. Everyone should make the decision for themselves.\" Kimmich will be absent from Julian Nagelsmann's side's upcoming fixtures versus Mainz (December 11), Stuttgart (December 14), live on Sky Sports, and Wolfsburg (December 17) prior to the Bundesliga's winter break. Live Bundesliga Nagelsmann tested positive for the virus in October but recovered fully after four games out and made a return to the dugout for their 5-2 win over Benfica at the start of November. When asked last month about some of his squad not yet receiving their jabs, Nagelsmann said: \"The players who are not vaccinated understand that the risk of missing games or training sessions is much greater as an unvaccinated person than as a vaccinated person.\" Bayern topped Group E in the Champions League with six wins from six and lead Dortmund by four points at the top of the Bundesliga heading into Saturday's clash with Mainz at the Allianz Arena. Bundesliga matches are to be limited to 50 per cent attendances and a maximum of 15,000 fans due to reintroduced Covid restrictions in Germany amid a spike in infections.\n",

COVID-19 cases are already “racing through” Ottawa’s French-language school boards, whose schools opened in late August, Evans said.

Article content “If the province will not act to protect our vulnerable children, we must.” While several trustees said they were also frustrated with the province, they also said it was not fair to deny unvaccinated children the right to go to in-person classes. The proposal was to enrol unvaccinated children without medical exemptions in virtual school. Ottawa Public Health discouraged the idea of mandatory vaccinations for students, said trustee Rob Campbell, who called advice from OPH his “north star” in making decisions about pandemic safety measures. A mandatory vaccination policy may also impair the ability of public health to build relationships with families and communities, Campbell said. Trustees heard that about 90 per cent of students aged 12 to 18 in Ottawa had received at least one dose. Advertisement 4 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content Two student trustees said some students in that age category may be unvaccinated for various reasons, such as pressure from parents. “Any student who would go behind their parent’s back may face severe consequences,” trustee Charles Chen said. He and student trustee AmaturRaheem Salam-Alada suggested unvaccinated students be given rapid COVID-19 tests instead. Trustee Christine Boothby said she is not a medical professional, but follows advice from OPH. If the school board moves unvaccinated students to online learning, they are not looking after their well-being and limiting their opportunity for learning, she said. “These kids need to be in school and not stigmatized.” Trustee Chris Ellis said that OPH had not succeeded in convincing the remaining 10 per cent of eligible students to get vaccinated and there was no indication that would happen.

Parent Steven McRoberts, who has children aged 11 and 13, said he feared possible long-term term risks of the vaccine. He said he and his wife may decide to get their children vaccinated later, but he doesn’t want to be pressured to do so now. Drew Klein told trustees that, “We as their parents have the right to decide what is best for them, not you.” “Can you believe that, in the year 2021 in Canada, how much time and energy we must allocate to protect, defend and fight for the basic human rights of our children to defend them from perpetually wrong, fear-mongering, pearl clutching, anti-science, data ignoring, hysterical … authorities in Ottawa’s education and public health departments,” Klein said.

Quebec goes all-in on mandatory vaccination Back to video Just days after federal Health Minister Jean-Yves Duclos said that he could see mandatory vaccinations “coming,” Quebec has proved him right. Quebec Premier François Legault announced Tuesday that his government will levy a “significant” tax on any Quebecer who henceforth refuses to show proof of vaccination. The measure is effectively the same as the world’s first-known mandatory COVID-19 vaccination policy in a Western democracy; a just-drafted law in Austria that would similarly impose punitive quarterly fines on any citizen failing to show updated COVID-19 shots. One of the policy’s most vocal critics is the far-left opposition party Quebec Solidaire. The party called it a “radical measure” that will punish vulnerable groups such as the homeless and “people with serious mental health problems.” Andrew Boozary, an Ontario physician and well-known commentator on Canadian health policy, lambasted the new Quebec measures as an effective “health care tax.” “I believe I have been as pro-vaccine as any in the country,” he wrote in a Tweet. “But Quebec taxing individuals who are not vaccinated is regressive and will undermine the Canada Health Act.” Advertisement 3 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.

In a Monday interview with CBC, New Brunswick Premier Blaine Higgs said compulsory immunization “will get further discussion” in his province. NOTE: In the Sunday edition of First Reading, we claimed that mandatory vaccination was an “unprecedented” policy that has never previously been pursued by a Canadian government. That’s not true: Quebec, New Brunswick and P.E.I. are all known to have had compulsory smallpox vaccination encoded into law in the 19th century. One such policy even triggered a riot in 1885 Montreal.

As recently as Jan. 3, Ontario’s top doctor Kieran Moore was sending letters to parents saying that school closures would be unnecessary (a decision that was backed by a public letter signed by more than 500 doctors imploring the government to keep schools open). This was nevertheless followed by Ontario Premier Doug Ford closing schools anyway only on a few days later, and now deciding that they’ll reopen next week. Two physicians, Alanna Golden and Martha Fulford, outlined in a column for the National Post why none of this makes any sense.

While Canada once recognized Taiwan as the legitimate representative of China, there have been no diplomatic links of any kind behind the two countries ever since that recognition shifted to Beijing in 1971. This week, Reuters reported that Canada and Taiwan were hammering out the details of an investment protection agreement. While such a measure may seem like a relatively harmless way for Canada to recognize its $7.87 billion annual trade links with Taiwan, expect it to spur threats of retaliation from Beijing, who make it a point to aggressively oppose anything that hints at recognition of Taiwan as an independent entity. Late last year, Lithuania had only to open a trade office in Taiwan to prompt a full trade embargo from Beijing.

      "A law firm representing international travellers is seeking a judicial review into the UK's quarantine hotel policy. Travellers arriving in the UK from a red list country must stay at a government-approved hotel for 11 nights, even if they have had both doses of a COVID-19 vaccine. But London-based PGMBM is arguing that forcing those who have been fully vaccinated and have recently tested negative is an \"unlawful deprivation of liberty\" and violates their human rights.

      "Health Secretary Sajid Javid was making a statement to Parliament when Sir Desmond Swayne made his feelings known (Picture: Getty Images) An anti-lockdown Tory MP let out a wail of disapproval in the House of Commons on Tuesday, when it was announced that face masks could become a legal requirement again. Sir Desmond Swayne groaned ‘no’ as the Health Secretary Sajid Javid announced that the coverings could be enforced by law once more, if Covid-19 makes a comeback in the colder months. The New Forest West MP’s howl was audible as Mr Javid read out his ‘Plan B’ of contingency measures, which also included making people work from home again. He told MPs: ‘We have seen how quickly this virus can adapt and change so we have prepared a Plan B of contingency measures that we can call upon only if they are needed and supported by the data to prevent unsustainable pressure on the NHS. ‘These measures would be communicating clearly and urgently the need for caution. Legally mandating face coverings in certain settings.’ At that point, the former Conservative minister Sir Desmond then made his feelings known. But Mr Javid ignored his protests and went on: ‘Whilst we’re not going ahead with mandatory vaccine-only Covid-status certification now, we will be holding that power in reserve. As well as these three steps, we’d consider a further measure of asking people to work from home if they can for a limited time if that is supported by the data.

He also admitted being ‘tempted’ to join an anti-lockdown demonstration and donating money to the conspiracy theorist and anti-vaccine activist Piers Corbyn. Face coverings were legally required indoors and on public transport for much of the pandemic, but the rules were relaxed on July 19. People are now encouraged to wear masks in such settings – though there has been debate around the example MPs are setting in the crowded indoor setting of Parliament, where the vast majority of Conservative politicians sit without wearing face coverings. The items have repeatedly been hailed as effective tools against the virus by various scientists. They catch droplets from people’s mouth and nose, significantly reducing the amount of virus which can go on to infect others in close contact with a positive case. However, others suggest that wearing face coverings impacts personal freedoms and argue people should be able to choose whether to wear them or not. Masks are still legally required in some settings, including on public transport in London. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.

Article content 2:25 p.m. Quebec unsure how close it is to meeting nursing target How close is Quebec to meeting the goal it set to overcome the dearth of nurses in the public system? Impossible to say because the province has few details about the part-time nurses who have agreed to go full-time. As it emerges from the pandemic, Quebec is focused on dealing with a chronic shortage of nurses that has been exacerbated by pandemic exhaustion and may soon be compounded by the suspension of some unvaccinated nurses. The province has said it needs “the equivalent of 4,300” extra nurses to deal with a shortage in the public health system. Since announcing a $1-billion plan to retain and recruit nurses, it has been providing regular updates on the effort, which includes bonuses of up to $18,000 for some nurses. Part of the initiative involves convincing part-time nurses to go full-time. Advertisement 5 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content As of last week, Quebec said: 83 nurses were coming out of retirement. 453 nurses were moving from the private sector to the public sector. 1,628 nurses who previously worked part-time were going full-time. However, it’s unclear how close Quebec is getting to its target of adding 4,300 full-time equivalent nurses. That’s because the government can’t quantify how many days that the previously part-time nurses were working before they agreed to go full time. Someone who goes from one day to five days per week, for example, would contribute more to the effort than one who moves from four days to five days. The Health Department does not have that information yet, spokesperson Marie-Louise Harvey told the Montreal Gazette today, noting that “currently, data is obtained through manual collection from establishments.” Advertisement 6 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content However, the spokesperson said “work is underway with payroll system providers for health and social services institutions” to allow officials to calculate how much each new worker is contributing to the effort. The Health Department “will soon be able to get the data directly from the system rather than requiring manual data collection. In a radio interview this morning, Premier François Legault appeared to contradict previous statements from health officials about the extent of the nursing shortage. He also appeared to contradict the statement from the Health Department. In his statement, the premier was referring to Quebec nurses who are still not vaccinated despite the province’s vaccine mandate.

In Asia, the Red Cross called for urgent help for Papua New Guinea and China’s latest outbreak forced the capital Beijing to delay its annual marathon and step up other curbs, less than four months before it hosts the Winter Olympics.

Article content Authorities around the world have been sounding the alarm as infections surge, with governments in regions where vaccine uptake has been low forced to toughen up restrictions in a bid to stop the virus from raging out of control. “The pandemic is far from over. Complacency is now as dangerous as the virus. Now is the time to be on heightened alert, not to let down your guard,” World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on Monday. Russia on Monday reported 37,930 new COVID-19 infections in the last 24 hours, its highest in a single day since the start of the pandemic, as well as 1,069 deaths related to the virus. Frustrated by the slow take-up of Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine by its own population, authorities are introducing stricter measures this week to try to curb the spread of the pandemic.

Article content Some regions imposed a workplace shutdown and from Thursday, Moscow will introduce its tightest lockdown measures since June 2020, with only essential shops like supermarkets and pharmacies open. Moscow schools are also closed, and unvaccinated over-60s in the capital have been ordered to lock down for four months. Vaccine skepticism is high across central and eastern Europe, and as a result the region has become a hotspot. Tougher restrictions came into force in Romania and the Czech Republic on Monday, while in Slovakia stricter rules were expanded to more regions. In Bulgaria, police will start imposing fines on people who break restrictions from Monday. Poland also warned it would consider tighter restrictions. In Romania, where a deputy minister on Saturday lamented a “disaster situation,” the government reintroduced a curfew and made health passes mandatory for entry to most public venues. While experts have said that a lack of confidence in public institutions caused by decades of Communist rule has fueled vaccine skepticism in the region, there were signs that more people were now getting a jab. 1:20 p.m. P.E.I. man gets his Vax Pass printed on a shirt Advertisement 10 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.

The assessment from Employment and Social Development Canada found that by early June, 1.5 million, or about 75 per cent of the 1.8 million unique recipients of the benefit, were continuous or repeat beneficiaries. Advertisement 11 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content Among them were some 627,000 recipients who applied and received the benefit for months at a time, never once taking a break. The Canadian Press obtained a copy of the briefing note to the top official at the department under the access to information law. Experts who reviewed the document suggested the analysis hints at the level of need for the income-support program, which came to an end over the weekend. As of Oct. 10, the CRB had paid out just over $27 billion to nearly 2.2 million applicants since launching in late September 2020, but had seen a steady decline in demand from its peak of 1.22 million recipients in January. By the end, there were about 800,000 people reliant on the payments who only had 48 hours to adjust their finances when the Liberals announced a change in the benefits package on Thursday. Advertisement 12 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content “Workers need the Canada Recovery Benefits to pay rent and not lose their housing. Many workers can only find part-time work & are not getting enough shifts to make ends meet. The pandemic is not over,” Deena Ladd, executive director of the Toronto-based Workers Action Centre, wrote in a tweet Sunday asking the Liberals to reinstate the benefit. The government said the CRB was no longer needed because the Canadian economy was faring better than a few months ago, including a labour market that had recovered the three million jobs lost at the onset of the pandemic last year. Similarly, Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland said, the wage subsidy was no longer required as she proposed a broadened credit for companies that hire new workers. Advertisement 13 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content Jennifer Robson, an associate professor of political management from Carleton University in Ottawa, said the Liberals’ announcement didn’t signal anything about the need for retraining or job-search services to help unemployed workers. “The hiring credit might, in theory, help some kinds of employers hire more staff, but there’s nothing here that would suggest this will do much in the short-term to help CRB users,” Robson wrote in an email. In their analysis, federal officials noted the number of first-time applicants for the CRB decreased starting in mid-January. The document also said more than 600,000 recipients who were paid in the first four months of the CRB’s life were off the benefit by the start of June. Advertisement 14 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content A similar trend was noticed among employment insurance claimants, “which indicates that Canadians have been steadily returning to work,” officials wrote, adding that EI claims for sales and service jobs “have yet to recover as quickly as other occupations.” CIBC chief economist Avery Shenfeld wrote in an end-of-week analysis that there is now a risk that workers supported by the wage subsidy or CRB “will be added to the ranks of the job hunters” and affect progress on bringing down the national unemployment rate. In place of the CRB, the Liberals introduced a rejigged $300-a-week benefit that would only go to workers who lose their jobs or income because of a government-ordered lockdown. In a television interview aired Sunday, Employment Minister Carla Qualtrough told CTV’s Question Period that the benefit would only go to those affected by a full lockdown and not tightened restrictions that limited capacity at restaurants, for instance.

His comments were echoed by Rochelle Walensky, head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which must ultimately approve the shots. “There will be vaccine out there so children can start rolling up their sleeves,” Walensky said on NBC.

Article content Health experts say vaccinating children will be a key step in helping end the U.S. outbreak, though a Kaiser Family Foundation study found in September that only about a third of parents would vaccinate their children immediately. Almost 65 million eligible Americans ages 12 and older are not vaccinated. Advisers to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration will meet Tuesday to consider data for children’s use of the vaccine by Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE. Approval by the FDA and the CDC is also required. A former head of the FDA on the weekend said children ages five to 11 should be vaccinated in their pediatrician’s offices. “Getting children vaccinated is a much more consultative endeavour,” said Scott Gottlieb, a board member of Pfizer, whose vaccine is to be considered for authorization for young children.

If museums and galleries, places of worship and personal care settings choose to require proof of vaccination, they can also lift capacity limits as of today.

Ford describes his approach to loosening restrictions as “super cautious.” 9:55 a.m. Nov. 15 vaccine deadline may only apply to some health workers, Legault says Quebec talked tough in September when it announced a vaccine mandate for health workers: Health Minister Christian Dubé said anyone who wasn’t vaccinated by Oct. 15 would be suspended without pay. For weeks, he insisted the deadline would stand because unvaccinated health sector employees could pose a danger to patients. Advertisement 20 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content But 48 hours before the deadline, it was pushed back to Nov. 15. Dubé insisted the new deadline was firm. “We want to give the unvaccinated staff extra time to get their dose,” he said at the time. “I want to be clear: we will apply the mandatory vaccination for health workers, but postponing the deadline by 30 days is the best solution under the circumstances.” Now, Quebec appears ready to backtrack again. In a radio interview Monday, Premier François Legault indicated the Nov. 15 deadline may be delayed again due to a labour shortage in the health system. “We hope to be able to apply the (vaccine mandate) decree,” he told 98.5 FM in one of a round of interviews he did with select media outlets. “We will surely be able to apply it in certain places. In emergencies, of course, it must be applied because there is very close contact with patients. There are regions where we will be able to apply it. What we want is to apply it everywhere.

      "Summary Summary Companies AstraZeneca, Novavax say their shots protect against Omicron UK data suggests fewer hospitalisations compared with Delta Do not extrapolate from South African data -African CDC boss WHO also urges caution about drawing firm conclusions JOHANNESBURG/LONDON, Dec 23 (Reuters) - Omicron advanced across the world on Thursday, with health experts warning the battle against the COVID-19 variant was far from over despite two drugmakers saying their vaccines protected against it and signs it carries a lower risk of hospitalisation. Coronavirus infections have soared wherever the highly infectious Omicron variant has spread, triggering new restrictions in many countries and record new cases. But in another glimmer of hope two days before Christmas, a U.S. Federal Drug Administration (FDA) official said data indicated that both Merck & Co Inc's (MRK.N) and Pfizer Inc's (PFE.N) COVID-19 anti-virals are effective against the variant. Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register There were encouraging signs too about hospitalisation rates from Britain and South Africa, although the head of a leading African health agency joined the World Health Organization in cautioning that it was too soon to draw broader conclusions. \"Let's be careful not to extrapolate what we are seeing in South Africa across the continent, or across the world,\" Africa Centres for Disease Control (CDC) chief John Nkengasong said. Nevertheless, U.S. stock indexes and yields on U.S. Treasuries both climbed on Thursday, partly on new optimism after Omicron helped ratchet up market volatility for much of the last month of 2021. read more \"Today is a very calm day. It’s the relief over Omicron apparently not being as bad as we feared,\" Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at LPL Financial, said. read more Even as Omicron has begun leaving an imprint on parts of the U.S. economy, economists say it so far seems unlikely to prevent a second straight year of above-trend growth. read more First identified last month in southern Africa and Hong Kong, Omicron is becoming dominant in much of Europe including Britain, where daily new infections have soared beyond 100,000. France had its worst-ever day in terms of new COVID-19 cases on Thursday, with more than 91,000 recorded, while Germany reported its first Omicron death. read more In Italy, the first Western country to be hit by the pandemic last year, all public New Year's Eve celebrations were banned, while Greece banned public Christmas festivities. Both countries also made outdoor mask-wearing mandatory. read more In the United States, millions of Americans pushed ahead with holidays including cross-country flights. Authorities said 2,081,297 passengers were screened through the nation's airports on Wednesday, 144,000 more than on the same date in 2019 before the pandemic. read more Increases in hospitalisations and deaths in South Africa and Britain since Omicron took hold appear to have been only gradual, and AstraZeneca(AZN.L) and Novavax(NVAX.O) joined other manufacturers in saying their shots protect against it. University of Edinburgh researchers who tracked 22,205 Omicron patients said on Wednesday the number who needed to be hospitalised was 68% lower than they would have expected, based on the rate in patients with Delta. Imperial College London researchers reported evidence of a comparable 40%-45% reduction in hospitalisation risk. Britain recorded a record number of new coronavirus cases on Thursday, with the daily tally reaching 119,789. But analysis of preliminary data by the UK Health Security Agency showed an individual with Omicron was estimated to be between 31% and 45% less likely to attend hospital compared to someone with Delta, and 50% to 70% less likely to be admitted. 1/8 A woman carries her luggage amid the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic at the central station in Berlin, Germany, December 22, 2021.

'DON'T OVER-INTERPRET' Scientists have warned that, with the surge in cases in Britain, even a small proportion of hospitalisations could overwhelm the healthcare system. In the U.S. Midwest, Omicron's rapid spread has hospitals \"preparing for the worst,\" with their personnel already severely strained from a wave of the Delta variant. read more The British data supported findings from South Africa's National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD). read more A separate South African government-backed study, yet to be peer-reviewed, on health workers given the Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) vaccine identified \"clear and early de-coupling\" of hospitalisation from Omicron cases compared with Delta. AstraZeneca said a three-course dose of its vaccine offered protection against the variant, citing data from an Oxford University lab study. Findings from the study, yet to be published in a peer-reviewed journal, matched those from rivals Pfizer-BioNTech (PFE.N), (22UAy.DE) and Moderna (MRNA.O). Novavax (NVAX.O) also said early data showed its vaccine - authorised for use by the European Union and WHO but yet to be approved by the United States - generated an immune response against Omicron. But the older Delta variant lurks. The coronavirus death toll in Russia, where officials had detected only 41 Omicron cases, passed 600,000 on Thursday, Reuters calculations based on official data showed, after a surge of Delta-linked infections. read more Only the United States and Brazil have recorded more coronavirus deaths.

Alberta ends nearly all COVID-19 restrictions and most mask rules starting Tuesday Photo by Darren Makowichuk / Postmedia Article content Alberta will end nearly all COVID-19 restrictions on Tuesday, including most mask rules, Premier Jason Kenney announced Saturday.

Article content We apologize, but this video has failed to load. tap here to see other videos from our team. Try refreshing your browser, or Alberta ends nearly all COVID-19 restrictions and most mask rules starting Tuesday Back to video Masks will only be required in some high-risk settings, like on public transit and in Alberta Health Services facilities like hospitals. However, some local masking bylaws remain in effect. Capacity limits for venues, restrictions on interactive activities, limited liquor service operating hours for bars and restaurants, and screening for youth activities will all be lifted on Tuesday. The remaining rules for schools will also end as will work-from-home mandates. Kenney, at the official opening of the new Grande Prairie Regional Hospital, told the crowd “the worst of COVID-19 is behind us” in Alberta and other parts of the world. He said pressure on hospitals is easing and promising trends show the province can safely move forward.

Article content “We just cannot continue to live our lives indefinitely with restrictions on our rights and freedoms and on our normal lives,” he said Saturday. “We are social creatures. We are designed to interact with each other … let us embrace that normalcy as we are able to lift these restrictions safely.” Kenney said Albertans will need to determine their own risk levels — such as if someone is immunocompromised — since COVID-19 is still here. “We have to shift to moving the responsibility from the entire society to a much more focused approach based on personal responsibility,” he said. “We don’t think it’s justifiable now to impose mandates on the entire society, particularly when there’s declining compliance, and we just don’t see the need.” Advertisement 4 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.

Chief medical officer of health Dr. Deena Hinshaw was not present at the Saturday event. Hospitalizations remain high Alberta’s COVID-19 hospitalizations are declining, but remain higher than the peaks of every previous wave of the pandemic — 1,295 patients with the disease were still in hospital by Friday. The number of those needing intensive care treatment, however, is lower. But Kenney said declining hospital numbers shows ending vaccine passports and other restrictions earlier this month hasn’t negatively impacted the health-care system. Asked if he worries the move may be hasty — Kenney previously conceded he was too optimistic with the 2021 Open For Summer, which led to hospitals being overwhelmed — the premier said this current approach is realistic and other jurisdictions have taken a similar appraoch.

We can’t predict with 100 per cent certainty what the future may bring, but what we do know historically from contagious respiratory viruses like this is that typically over time they become less severe,” he said. Countries like England, Denmark, Norway and Sweden have lifted all COVID-19 restrictions. Alberta’s reported COVID-19 case numbers are not comparable to previous waves of the pandemic since the province ended widespread PCR testing in December. While Kenney acknowledged the gap in true numbers, he said if transmission of the disease was increasing then the number of people being admitted to hospital for the disease would also be going up. Kenney also pointed out wastewater data shows the virus in decline or stabilizing in many communities. Scientists involved in the wastewater testing program have said this data is not comparable to PCR testing and is not a replacement.

Edmonton’s mask bylaw is still in effect indoors for people ages two and up in public places regulated by the city. Mayor Amarjeet Sohi said Saturday he doesn’t agree with the province’s approach. “I’m disappointed to hear that all COVID protections are being removed including masking,” he said in an email. “These protections have helped to keep us safe during an incredibly difficult few years.” Edmonton’s rules stay in place unless there’s a vote at city hall to change them. Council planned to trigger a review after active cases drop below 100 per 100,000 people for 28 consecutive days.

      "Vaccines use components of infectious agents such as bacteria and viruses to stimulate the body’s immune system to recognise and mark them for destruction, preventing the infectious agents from replicating and causing infection. This article is the fifth in a six-part series about the lymphatic system Abstract This article, the fifth in a six-part series on the lymphatic system, examines the role of antibodies in developing immunity to infectious viruses and bacteria. It also summarises the history of vaccine development and explains how different vaccines stimulate an immune response.

This article, the fifth in a six-part series on the lymphatic system, examines in greater detail the nature of antibody-mediated immunity discussed in part 3 and explores how vaccines can be used to prime the immune system against infectious diseases. Antibody-mediated immunity and role of B-lymphocytes As highlighted in part 3, which discussed the role of the lymphatic system in developing immunity, antibodies are produced by B-lymphocytes when the body is exposed to foreign material. Any foreign material that can elicit a specific immune response and stimulate the production of antibodies is referred to as an antigen (Aryal, 2018). This article focuses on those associated with pathogens that cause infectious diseases. When antibodies are generated during infection their major role is to bind to the infectious agent, ‘marking’ it for destruction by the immune system; this process is termed opsonisation (see part 3). The structure of antibodies Antibodies (also known as immunoglobulins) are soluble globular proteins. The most abundant antibody circulating in the blood is immunoglobulin G (IgG), which accounts for around 10-20% of the total plasma protein content (Vidarsson et al, 2014). Antibodies have a characteristic molecular configuration, often described as resembling the letter Y. Each molecule consists of four polypeptide (protein) chains, linked by disulphide bonds (Fig 1). Each antibody molecule consists of two heavy chains and two light chains in a Y shape (Fig 1a); the stem region is constant but the terminal ends of the arms are highly variable. These variable portions are the antigen-binding sites and resemble three-dimensional clefts or pockets into which the corresponding antigen will fit. Antibody molecules are highly specific: each is usually only able to bind to a single antigen (Fig 1b). Just as a key will only fit one particular lock, an antigen will only fit into its complementary antibody by slotting into one of its antigen-binding sites – this is essential to the way antibodies recognise and bind to foreign material. When antibodies are generated against a pathogen, most bind to that pathogen alone, although some can bind to molecules with similar configurations as their original target antigen (Jain and Salunke, 2019). Such cross-reactivity is known to be associated with many autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatic fever. Clonal selection The process of clonal selection (Fig 2) is at the heart of antibody-mediated immunity. B-cells (B-lymphocytes), which generate antibodies, circulate in the blood and are also present in lymphoid organs, such as the spleen, bone marrow and lymph nodes. A typical human body has billions of B-cells, with many displaying antibody molecules with unique antigen-binding sites. The red circle in Fig 2 represents a particle of foreign material such as a bacterium or virus. When pathogens enter the body they typically circulate in the blood and lymph and through the lymphoid organs, and randomly come into contact with B-cells. The antigens on the surface of the pathogen will fit into the antigen-binding site of a complementary antibody molecule just like a key slotting into a lock (Fig 2). Once this occurs, clonal selection is deemed to have taken place; the B-cell will divide repeatedly, producing a large population of clones of the original B-cell (Silverstein, 2002). The majority of newly generated B-cell clones mature and enlarge into antibody-producing plasma cells, which release antibodies (IgG) into the blood (Fig 2). These will circulate throughout the body and bind to and opsonise the pathogen when they encounter it, marking it for destruction. B-cells and immunological memory Not all B-cells generated by clonal selection mature into antibody-producing plasma cells. A significant proportion remain in the body for many years as memory cells (Ratajczak et al, 2018). These display the same antibody as the original B-cell clone and effectively hold a long-term ‘memory’ of the encounter (Fig 2). If the pathogen is encountered again, these memory cells ensure clonal selection can occur quickly, allowing rapid killing of the pathogen before it can cause disease. B-memory cells and the logic of vaccination There are many different forms of vaccination, but all work on the same basic principle of priming the immune system against a potential infectious pathogen. This involves introducing a harmless form of the pathogen (or a component derived from it) to initiate clonal selection, antibody production and production of a pool of circulating memory cells. “Just as a key will only fit one particular lock, an antigen will only fit into its complementary antibody” Early history of vaccination English physician Edward Jenner’s use of a cowpox inoculation to provide immunity against the deadly smallpox virus is recognised as a key foundation in the newly emerging field of immunology and led to the development of the first effective and widely used vaccine. Jenner noted that milkmaids frequently contracted the relatively mild viral infection cowpox, which appeared to protect them against smallpox. He began using cowpox inoculation in 1796 but it was not until 1840 that widespread vaccination against smallpox using the cowpox vaccine became available (Riedel, 2005). International use of smallpox vaccines led to its global eradication in 1980 and it remains the only infectious disease to be completely eradicated through the use of vaccination. Following Jenner’s success, research into vaccines boomed and has continued since with key vaccines developed against some of the most virulent and deadly human pathogens, including those causing typhoid (1896), diphtheria (1942), polio (1956), measles (1968) and rubella (1970). Types of vaccines Heterologous vaccines These are the earliest vaccines successfully used to confer immunity. They use micro-organisms that display limited pathogenicity in humans to stimulate the production of antibody and memory cells against highly pathogenic bacteria and viruses; because this is how Jenner’s original smallpox vaccine using cowpox functioned, these types of vaccines are often referred to as Jennerian vaccines (Esparza et al, 2018). With more advanced vaccine techniques now available, there are few pure heterologous vaccines that are in general use today, although the Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine, which provides protection against tuberculosis (TB), is an example of an attenuated heterologous vaccine. Attenuated live vaccines These vaccines use live micro-organisms that have been rendered less pathogenic (attenuated) either by culturing and selecting for less virulent strains or by manipulating the biological properties of the pathogen. Once administered, the constituent micro-organisms replicate freely within the body, generating a natural immune response but without causing the disease. A major advantage of these vaccines is that they elicit a powerful immune response that closely mirrors that seen in people exposed to the disease-causing pathogen. They tend to generate high antibody titres (concentrations) and a large pool of circulating memory cells, meaning booster shots are not usually required. Attenuated live vaccines are not usually offered to people with a weakened immune system because, in the absence of a normal immune response, the component pathogens can replicate quickly, potentially leading to serious systemic infection. People who are likely to be immunosuppressed include those with congenital immune deficiencies, those undergoing chemotherapy or radiotherapy, transplant recipients and patients using corticosteroids to manage chronic inflammatory or autoimmune disease (Arvas, 2014). One of the first attenuated vaccines developed was the BCG vaccine, which is used to vaccinate against Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the bacterium causing TB. BCG uses the closely related pathogen M bovis, which causes TB in cattle and is a zoonotic bacterium (capable of crossing species barriers and infecting a variety of animals). It can also infect humans, causing zoonotic TB, which has symptoms often indistinguishable from those caused by M tuberculosis (World Health Organization, 2017). In 1908 French microbiologists Albert Calmette and Camille Guérin began culturing M bovis isolated from an infected cow. After 11 years and over 230 subcultures, they isolated a strain that failed to cause TB in a variety of experimental animals. This attenuated strain was named Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) and was first used to vaccinate humans against TB in 1921. Initially the vaccine was given orally, before intradermal administration into the skin became commonplace (Luca and Mihaescu, 2013). Early vaccinations proved successful in conferring immunity against TB, and many countries adopted BCG vaccination. However, in 1930 a batch of BCG vaccine contaminated with virulent bacteria caused the deaths of 73 infants in the German city of Lübeck. The so-called ‘Lübeck disaster’ was caused by negligent production of the vaccine. It undermined confidence in the vaccine worldwide (Fox et al, 2016) and is generally recognised as the first major incident to cast global doubt on the safety of vaccines. It was not until the 1940s and 1950s, when TB infections increased significantly, that the BCG vaccine was used again in vaccination programmes and proven to be safe. Recent evaluations suggest that BCG is 70-80% effective in protecting against severe forms of TB, although it is less effective in adults than in children. Its widespread use has dramatically reduced the incidence of TB in many countries, although infections have started to rise again in many regions, along with antibiotic-resistant strains of M tuberculosis. Due to its relatively low incidence in the UK, the BCG vaccine is only given on the NHS to children and adults at increased risk of TB (NHS, 2019a). BCG remains one of the world’s most widely used vaccines and is also used as an immunotherapy to upregulate the immune system in the treatment of bladder cancer (see part 6). Modified forms are also used to enhance immune responses in the treatment of a variety of bacterial, viral and parasitic diseases (Zheng et al, 2015) and it is currently being evaluated for use in treating Covid-19 (Curtis and Sparrow, 2020). Other attenuated vaccines used in the UK vaccination schedule include MMR (measles, mumps and rubella), nasal flu, shingles, chickenpox and rotavirus vaccines (Vaccine Knowledge Project, 2019). Inactivated whole-pathogen vaccines These vaccines incorporate whole pathogens that have been killed, usually by heating or by exposing them to noxious chemicals or ionising radiation, rendering them unable to infect, replicate and cause disease. The current polio vaccine is an inactivated whole-pathogen vaccine; and is initially given as a component of the 6-in-1 vaccine, which also affords protection against diphtheria, hepatitis B, Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), tetanus and pertussis (whooping cough). The 6-in-1 vaccine is given as three doses at eight, 12 and 16 weeks of age (NHS, 2019b). Subsequent boosters are required at the age of: Three years and four months, as part of the 4-in-1 (diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough and polio) preschool booster (NHS, 2019c); 14 years, as part of the 3-in-1 (diphtheria, tetanus and polio) teenage booster (NHS, 2019d). Because inactivated whole-pathogen vaccines cannot replicate, they tend to elicit much weaker and shorter-lived immune responses than live attenuated vaccines. Repeated doses are required to generate an adequate immune response, followed by booster vaccinations to maintain immunity. To help enhance the immune response to inactivated vaccines, the killed pathogen is usually suspended in a fluid containing irritants such as aluminium salts, which act as an adjuvant. When injected, adjuvants initiate an inflammatory response, increasing blood flow to the site to strengthen and amplify the immune response. The inflammation initiated by adjuvants can result in tenderness and pain at the injection site, which usually resolves after a few days (Vaccine Knowledge Project, 2019). Because inactivated whole-pathogen vaccines contain no viable pathogen, they can usually be given safely to immunocompromised patients (Arvas, 2014). Other examples of inactivated whole-pathogen vaccines include the annual winter influenza vaccine and the rabies vaccine (Vaccine Knowledge Project, 2019). Subunit vaccines Unlike inactivated whole-pathogen vaccines, subunit vaccines contain no intact bacterial or viral particles but use fragments of material derived from the target micro-organism. The pathogen-derived subunits chosen are typically components of bacterial cell walls and viral envelopes, as these are the natural antigens that would trigger clonal selection and antibody production during infection. Today most subunit vaccines are made using recombinant DNA techniques. A good example is the vaccine for the hepatitis B virus (HBV); here the gene for an antigen on the HBV surface is inserted into brewer’s yeast. This genetically modified yeast can be cultured and will synthesise the HBV surface antigen, which can be harvested and purified for use in the HBV vaccine (Das et al, 2019). Subunit vaccines are particularly useful for highly pathogenic micro-organisms, as the lack of any intact viable pathogen ensures infection is impossible, even in severely immunocompromised patients. Many of the vaccines currently being developed against SARS-Cov-2 are subunit vaccines using the surface spike protein that allows the virus to enter its target cells. The vaccine developed at the University of Oxford designated ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, which is currently being rolled out, takes the gene for the SARS-Cov-2 spike protein and inserts it into a non-pathogenic chimpanzee adenovirus. Following vaccination, the genetically modified adenovirus will infect target cells, which then synthesise large quantities of the SARS-Cov-2 spike protein, triggering antibody production. If the vaccinated patient comes into contact with SARS-Cov-2, their immune system will be able to target the virus and prevent infection (Mahase, 2020a). Toxoid vaccines The symptoms associated with many bacterial infections are caused by toxins produced by the pathogen. For example, Corynebacterium diphtheria (responsible for diphtheria) generates a powerful toxin that inhibits protein synthesis in the body, damaging the respiratory tract, nerves and heart (Murtaza et al, 2016). The diphtheria vaccine uses a modified version of this toxin, which has been inactivated with a chemical (usually formalin). The modified toxin is referred to as a toxoid (toxin-like molecule); because it is structurally almost identical to the original diphtheria toxin, it elicits antibody production when used in a vaccine. If a vaccine recipient becomes infected with diphtheria, these antibodies bind to and neutralise the diphtheria toxin – reducing or eliminating symptoms. Although the pathogen itself is not being targeted, eventually the person’s immune system can target and eliminate the C diphtheria bacterium itself. Conjugated vaccines Some antigens on the surface of pathogens do not naturally elicit a strong immune response when used in vaccines. Conjugated vaccines can improve immune responses to these relatively weak antigens by linking (conjugating) them to other molecules, such as bacterial toxoids, which generate more robust immune reactions. The Hib vaccine is a good example of a conjugated vaccine. Hib is unrelated to viral influenza; it is a bacterial infection that typically infects babies and young children, causing potentially life-threating septicaemia and bacterial meningitis. The Hib vaccine takes portions of the bacterial cell wall and conjugates them to toxoids (commonly tetanus or diphtheria toxoids) to render them more powerful elicitors of antibody production (Heath and McVernon, 2002). DNA and RNA vaccines With recent advances in molecular biology allowing the rapid sequencing and manipulation of DNA, attention has turned to using this technology to design and produce a new generation of vaccines. DNA and RNA vaccines use the body’s own cells to make antigenic components of bacteria and viruses to trigger an immune response. For example, a DNA vaccine can be created by inserting the sequence of a viral protein into a small, ring-shaped piece of DNA called a plasmid, which is then injected into a muscle. The muscle cells take up the plasmid and use the information encoded in its sequences to make the viral protein; this stimulates the production of antibodies via normal clonal selection. Although DNA vaccines are already licensed for veterinary use, none are yet licenced for use in humans. However, clinical trials are exploring their use against a variety of human pathogens, including the Ebola, Marburg and Zika viruses. Early results have been encouraging, with boostable antibody production reported (Liu, 2019). The current coronavirus pandemic has advanced novel vaccine development: one of the first SARS-Cov-2 vaccines to undergo clinical trials was an RNA-based vaccine developed in the US. This uses messenger RNA (mRNA) sequences that code for the SARS-Cov-2 spike protein (Fig 3); these are enveloped in a lipid coating and injected into the deltoid muscle. The mRNA will then initiate production of the spike protein in human cells, stimulating production of antibodies against the virus. Initial findings reported in July 2020 indicated the vaccine is effective in producing specific immune responses against SARS-Cov-2 without any trial-limiting safety concerns (Jackson et al, 2020). The vaccine, now known as the Moderna vaccine, was approved for use in the US in December 2020; earlier that month a similar RNA vaccine, developed by Pfizer and BioNTech, became the first SARS-Cov-2 vaccine to receive regulatory approval in the UK (Mahase, 2020b). Risks associated with reduced vaccine uptake The anti-vaccination movement is as old as modern vaccination itself. When the effectiveness of Jenner’s smallpox vaccine became apparent, the Vaccination Act in 1840 made it mandatory for parents in the UK to vaccinate their children. This led to significant public opposition and the formation of the Anti-Vaccination League, which successfully campaigned for removal of penalties and for parents’ right to conscientiously object to vaccination (Hussain et al, 2018). Although the contaminated BCG vaccine that led to the Lübeck disaster shook public confidence in early TB vaccination programmes, the effectiveness of successive new vaccines against a variety of deadly diseases ensured that vaccine uptake was maintained at a high level. The modern anti-vaccination movement was given great impetus by a paper published in The Lancet that linked the MMR vaccine with the development of autism in young children (Wakefield et al, 1998). Despite being widely criticised in the scientific community, and later retracted by The Lancet, there was widespread loss of public confidence in the vaccine. In the UK, uptake of the MMR vaccine dropped from 92% in 1996 to 84% in 2002 – and in parts of London to as low as 61% – which is far below the threshold required for herd immunity against measles. Unsurprisingly, cases increased significantly and in 2008 measles was declared endemic in the UK for the first time in 14 years (Hussain et al, 2018). MMR vaccination has recovered in recent years and, currently, scheduled childhood vaccine uptake in the UK remains high. However, there is a major concern that increased use of the internet and social media to promote anti-vaccination messages will further undermine confidence in the safety of vaccines and reduce uptake (Gilroy, 2019). Key points Foreign materials that elicit a specific immune response and stimulate the production of antibodies when they enter the body are called antigens Most antibodies are created to recognise and bind to one specific antigen All vaccines work by priming the immune system against a potential infectious pathogen Early vaccines used inoculation of a similar but harmless pathogen to develop immunity to deadly pathogens Modern vaccines use various methods to stimulate immune response, including inactivated or modified pathogens or fragments of the target pathogen References Arvas A (2014) Vaccination in patients with immunosuppression.

Article content From The Canadian Press: Canada’s chief public health officer warned Friday the country is in a period of pandemic transition that might see further waves of COVID-19 cases this year. “We anticipate that progress will not be linear, and there will likely be more bumps along the way, including a resurgence in cases this spring, and likely also in the fall and winter,” said Dr. Theresa Tam. COVID-19 is still circulating widely and the risk of re-emergence remains, Tam said during a news briefing. Tam advised Canadians to keep wearing masks and ensure vaccinations are up to date due to the risk of a rise in cases and in light of reduced public health measures. Canada is observing a steady increase in the BA.2 variant of COVID-19, and ongoing genomic surveillance will remain crucial for monitoring variants of concern, she said.

Article content Keeping an eye on wastewater trends can also be a helpful tool for monitoring COVID-19 transmission in communities, Tam said. An increase in in-person activities, the presence of the BA.2 variant and waning immunity might have played a part in the increase in transmission. Tam said that as of Thursday, daily average case counts had increased by 28 per cent nationally, suggesting a resurgence is underway. A rise in hospitalizations could therefore be seen in the country, Tam said, noting that these trends may vary by region. But she added Canadians are now in a better position to live with the virus, and the overall effect on the health-care system might be more manageable due to high immunity in the population from vaccination and recent infection.

Article content 10:10 a.m. Quebec pharmacists can now prescribe Paxlovid treatment for COVID As of today, Quebecers who have COVID-19 can turn to pharmacists for prescriptions for Paxlovid, an oral treatment that reduces the severity of symptoms and the risk of hospitalization or death. The drug is reserved for people at risk of developing serious complications, the provincial government says. They include people who are severely immunocompromised or who have chronic illnesses and are inadequately vaccinated. The Order of Pharmacists of Quebec is urging people interested in Paxlovid not to physically go to pharmacies if they have tested positive. “In these situations, if you are one of the target clientele, contact your pharmacy instead for a telephone consultation,” the order said in a statement. Advertisement 13 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content It noted that the drug should be taken within five days of the onset of symptoms. Pharmacists “will carry out an assessment,” the order said. “Following this, (he or she) will judge whether a prescription is possible. They could decide, for example, not to prescribe the medication or to refer you to another professional.” Here’s what the Quebec government’s COVID website says about eligibility for Paxlovid: According to the recommendations issued by the Institut national d’excellence en santé et en services sociaux (INESSS), Paxlovid is intended for people with COVID-19 who are at high risk of complications and meet the following criteria: Adults who are moderately to severely immunocompromised owing to an underlying condition or the treatment they are receiving for this condition (regardless of their vaccination status); People aged 60 or older, not adequately vaccinated (fewer than two doses) or not protected against COVID-19; People aged 18 or older, not adequately vaccinated (fewer than two doses) or not protected against COVID-19, and presenting with one of the following health conditions: hemoglobinopathy, obesity with a body mass index greater than or equal to 35, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, liver failure, high blood pressure, cardiovascular and atherosclerotic disease, chronic respiratory disease (for example, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or moderate to severe asthma); Adolescents weighing at least 40 kg and pregnant women, who present with at least one of the conditions listed above and who are not adequately vaccinated (fewer than two doses) or not protected against COVID-19, after discussion with a medical specialist or an experienced health professional; Exceptionally, adults who are adequately protected or vaccinated presenting with a very high risk of COVID-19 complications (for example, very old age, several co-existing medical conditions among those listed above, especially if uncontrolled, and with poor protection against the circulating variant despite a complete vaccination series), after discussion with a medical specialist or an experienced health professional. ‼️Les pharmaciens peuvent dorénavant prescrire l’antiviral PaxlovidMC aux patients symptomatiques de la COVID-19 à risque de développer des complications et qui présentent un résultat positif à un test de dépistage.

Try refreshing your browser, or 'I see it coming': Mandatory vaccinations on the horizon, federal health minister says Back to video Asked about mandatory vaccination, he said in French, “I personally think we will get there at some point.” According to a translation on CBC, he added, “I see it coming personally. Not now. I don’t think we are there yet. But I think discussions need to be had about mandatory vaccinations because we have to get rid of COVID-19.” Duclos told a press conference that any decision would be in the hands of provincial governments, but he said the unvaccinated were creating a sizeable burden on others. “What we see now is that our health care system in Canada is fragile. Our people are tired and the only way as we know through COVID–19, be it this variant or any future variant, is through vaccination,” he said.

Article content He said in Quebec, where his riding is located, hospitals were under serious pressure. “I see in my own province 50 per cent of hospitalizations now in Quebec are due to people not having been vaccinated,” he said. “That’s a burden on healthcare workers, a burden on society which is very difficult to bear and for many people difficult to understand.” More On This Topic Why Canada is shutting down during Omicron while the U.S. stays open Erin O'Toole urges 'reasonable accommodations' for unvaccinated Canadians In a statement later Friday, Duclos’s office stressed that the decision was in provincial hands. “Provinces and territories will continue to take decisions that are within their jurisdiction. As a government, we will continue to do everything we can within our federal authority to keep Canadians safe.” Advertisement 4 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content Alberta Premier Jason Kenney made clear his province would never consider such a step. “Alberta’s Legislature removed the power of mandatory vaccination from the Public Health Act last year and will not revisit that decision, period,” he said. “While we strongly encourage those who are eligible to get vaccinated, it is ultimately a personal choice that individuals must make.” Both vaccinated and unvaccinated Canadians are catching the Omicron variant, but provincial data has shown that unvaccinated people are much more likely to require hospital care. Some European countries have implemented vaccine requirements, Greece will fine anyone over 60 who is not vaccinated, $144 per month starting next week. Austria has a similar policy with higher fines amounting to over $5,000 every three months. Italy has made vaccines compulsory for people over age 50 and German legislators are considering similar steps.

Article content This week Quebec announced it was expanding its mandatory vaccination passport system so people in the province would eventually need three doses of a vaccine to get certain services. The province also announced that it was extending its passport system for people who wanted to enter liquor and pot stores. Canada has had vaccine mandates for certain occupations and for school children to combat some diseases, but never a broad-based policy requiring vaccination. The current COVID-19 vaccine mandates for employment have faced legal challenges, but so far courts have found the mandates are in line with the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The federal government has imposed a vaccine requirement on travellers and public servants, as well as on workers in federal regulated industries like travel.

Article content Conservative Opposition leader Erin O’Toole did not address Duclos comments Friday, but on Thursday he said the government’s existing policies were already dividing people and the government should find a balance. “Reasonable accommodations could and should be found for a small number of Canadians who may not be vaccinated,” he said. Duclos said measures like rapid tests are simply not enough to control the virus and allow Canadians to move past the pandemic. “Rapid tests are not going to end the crisis. Rapid tests are not going to solve COVID-19. The only thing that will solve COVID-19 is vaccination.” COVID-19 cases are continuing to surge across the country, as the much more transmissible Omicron variant spreads widely. Advertisement 7 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content Dr. Theresa Tam, Canada’s chief public health officer, said the country is currently seeing an average of around 42,000 cases per day, up 65 per cent from a week ago. In previous waves of the virus, case numbers that high would have swamped hospitals, but the Omicron variant is much less likely to lead to hospitalization in vaccinated people. Still, the sheer number of new infections has increased the number of Canadians in hospital by 91 per cent over the last week. The federal government has sent support to provinces with small teams of doctors and nurses, but Interprovincial Affairs Minister Dominic Leblanc made clear Friday the government would reach a limit to the help it could provide “We’re moving expeditiously to do obviously everything we can, but it’s no surprise that provincial and territorial governments have considerably more health human resources than the Government of Canada,” he said. “It shouldn’t surprise anybody that it’s not a limitless number of federal health care resources that we can bring to bear.” Provinces have the constitutional responsibility for health care and the federal government has a very small number of medical staff on its payroll, most of whom are in the armed forces. • Email: rtumilty@postmedia.com | Twitter: ryantumilty Share this article in your social network Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.

      "Global pharmaceutical company Janssen is beginning clinical trials of a potential COVID-19 vaccine in the UK. Around the country, 6,000 volunteers are taking part in phase-three trials of the COVID-19 vaccine at 17 National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) sites, including in Southampton, Bristol, Cardiff, London, Leicester, Sheffield, Manchester, Dundee and Belfast. It is the third potential coronavirus vaccine to enter clinical trials in the UK, alongside US biotech company Novavax and University of Oxford/AstraZeneca whose studies are currently ongoing. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 6:26 What does the Janssen vaccine trial involve? The start of the trial comes a week after the breakthrough announced by Pfizer and BioNtech that early results showed its vaccine was more than 90% effective. Professor Saul Faust, director of the NIHR Southampton Clinical Research Facility and chief investigator for the Janssen phase-three trial, told Sky News: \"The Janssen vaccine is very similar to the Oxford/Astra Zeneca vaccine in that it's an adapted cold virus that can't replicate in the body and can't give us a cold and can't give us coronavirus but it shows the body's immune system the spike protein to let us make immune responses to it. Advertisement :: Subscribe to the Daily podcast on Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts, Spotify, Spreaker \"The Pfizer announcement last week was really exciting because we didn't know until last week that a vaccine will be able to stop coronavirus at all. \"All the companies are making vaccines against the spike protein so we're really hopeful that the vaccines will all work to a greater or lesser extent and it's really important that we have a number of different vaccines from a number of different companies because we have no idea whether one vaccine will work in all age groups or across all populations and we've no idea really whether the vaccine supply will be able to come from one company the whole time and supply the entire world.\" Paul Stoffels, chief scientific officer for Janssen parent firm Johnson & Johnson, told Sky's Ian King Live he expected high demand in the UK for Janssen vaccine trial volunteers as they were recruiting more than 1,000 people daily for a separate US trial. He said: \"There are more vulnerable people like the elderly... and those with conditions like diabetes, heart disease. \"We would like to study the vaccine on those populations where people need it most first and that's the goal to learn, in a very broad population, diverse population, whether the vaccine is active and protects for COVID.\" Business Secretary Alok Sharma responded: \"The start of further clinical trials in the UK is yet another step forward in the race to discover a safe and effective vaccine, and comes alongside recent news that we could be on the cusp of the first major breakthrough since the pandemic began. \"While we are optimistic with the progress being made, there are no guarantees and it is possible there will be no one-size-fits-all vaccine. That is why it is absolutely vital that while our scientists are cracking on with the job, we continue to follow the guidance to control the virus, protect the NHS and save lives.\" Meanwhile, the Labour leader has called on the prime minister to publish a comprehensive national action plan for rolling out a future coronavirus vaccine \"that harnesses all of the talents of the British people\". In a letter to Boris Johnson, Sir Keir Starmer has written: \"The challenge facing the country now is not just how we get control of the virus, but how we get ready for the vaccine. \"We are world leaders in vaccines and I believe we should be aiming for a world class programme for rolling it out. However, this will be a mammoth logistical operation, probably larger than we have seen since the Second World War. If we are to get it right, then we must have a clear plan in place now.\" Professor Martin McKee, from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, is a member of Independent SAGE and among the scientists warning that the roll-out of a vaccine may not be the silver bullet people are hoping for. \"We need to recognise that on their own they're not going to solve the problem. \"We need to have them as part of an integrated strategy that includes a really good test and trace and isolate system for quite some time yet, we're going to have to maintain many of the social distancing measures that we have until everybody is vaccinated, until we've really got this under control. \"So they're an important element, but we shouldn't put all our eggs in one basket. \"We also have to recognise that there will be some vaccine hesitancy as well.\" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 2:10 Will ethnicity be a factor in COVID vaccinations? Over 300,000 people have signed up to the NHS Vaccines Registry to take part in coronavirus vaccine studies. The NHS vaccine registry particularly needs volunteers who are most vulnerable to the effects of coronavirus, including frontline health and social care workers and people from black, Asian and ethnic minority backgrounds. Dr Vanessa Apea, black, Asian and minority ethnic clinical champion at NIHR Clinical Research Network North Thames, said: \"COVID-19 still poses a significant threat to our health and our communities and many of us are still vulnerable to it. One of the ways we can reduce the threat and impact of this disease is a vaccine. \"The topic of vaccines divides communities. For many, and in particular, black, Asian and ethnic minority communities, the word vaccine generates a lot of anxiety, rooted in mistrust, which can understandably lead to reluctance in taking part in a trial. \"We know that these communities are disproportionately affected by COVID-19 and this makes it even more important that any outcomes from research, including new treatments and ways to prevent the disease, work for all communities.\" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 4:06 COVID-19 vaccine: Will it end the crisis? \"Only by doing this can we truly take control of COVID-19, so we really need people from black, Asian and ethnic minority communities to sign up to learn more and be part of research,\" she added. \"Entering a clinical trial or receiving a vaccine is entirely a personal choice and should always be supported by accurate information.\" People can sign up for ongoing trials via the NHS Vaccine Research Registry at nhs.uk/researchcontact\n",

      "(CNN) — There's nothing quite like a festive market to bring out the Christmas spirit in people. While these events can be traced back to Vienna -- the city's first recorded December market was in 1298 -- the tradition has spread across the world over the centuries. From Germany, to Switzerland, to New York, it's difficult to find a coveted destination that doesn't hold an impressive annual advent market. In fact, some have grown so popular, they've become tourist attractions in their own right. Unfortunately, a number of well-known festive markets did not take place last year due to the pandemic, while some, including Munich 's iconic market, have taken the decision to cancel celebrations for 2021 as a result of rising Covid-19 cases across Europe. Here's our rundown of the 2021 Christmas markets that have gone ahead, as well as some of those that have been called off. All information is correct as of November 30, 2021, but please do check before traveling. Viennese Dream Christmas Market, Austria Viennese Dream Christmas Market is one of the city's oldest and most traditional events. Lisi Niesner/Reuters With reindeer rides, a giant ferris wheel and a classic nativity scene to marvel at, Vienna's magical spectacle encapsulates the festive spirit fantastically. Although there are around 20 Christmas markets in the Austrian capital to choose from, the Viennese Christmas Dream, held in front of City Hall, or Rathausplatz, is one of its oldest and most traditional events. At the event, also known as Wiener Christkindlmarkt, you'll find over 150 stalls offering up tasty treats like Austrian sausages and gingerbread cookies, along with homemade Christmas punch. The famous Tree of Hearts, a giant maple tree decked out with hundreds of glittering hearts, is a hot favorite with visitors and a great photo opportunity. Is it going ahead this year? No. Viennese Dream Christmas Market is closed until the end of Austria's current lockdown. Basel Christmas Market, Switzerland Basel Christmas Market consists of nearly 200 wooden stalls selling Christmas spices, decorations and candles. Image Broker/Shutterstock It's hard to find a destination that does Christmas better than Switzerland. Most Swiss towns are pretty much taken over by festive markets at this time of year and the atmosphere is incredible. Basel Christmas Market is the biggest and arguably the best around. Separated into two different sections at Barfusserplatz and Munsterplatz, it's made up of nearly 200 fabulously decorated stalls selling Christmas spices, decorations and candles. Families will particularly enjoy the Christmas fairytale forest at Munsterplatz thanks to activities such as gingerbread and candle decorating, a star workshop and a festive train. Is it going ahead this year? Yes. Basel Christmas Market opened on November 25 and is scheduled to run until December 23. All guests aged 16 or over must produce a valid Swiss or EU Digital Covid Certificate, which serves as proof of vaccination, testing and recovery, as well as an identity document in order to enter. Strasbourg Christmas Market, France Dating back to 1570, Strasbourg Christmas Market lights up this French city annually. Frederick Florini/AFP/Getty Images One of Europe's oldest Christmas markets, Strasbourg began back in 1570, but it's evolved considerably since then. Spread over more than 10 locations, including a section of the UNESCO world heritage site of Grande Île, the hugely popular market lights up the city with thousands of twinkling Christmas lights and festive ornaments. Pre-Covid, an estimated two million people a year attended the market, which features around 300 wooden chalet stalls selling everything from decorations and presents to local Alsatian wine. Place Klebe is probably its most popular spot thanks to the Great Christmas Tree on display, as well as the ice skating rink erected underneath. But visitors will find plenty of magical sights while wandering through the city's narrow alleyways and pretty squares. Is it going ahead this year? Yes. Strasbourg Christmas Market kicked off on November 26 and is due to close on December 30. All visitors are required to wear masks and follow social distancing regulations. Brussels Winter Wonders, Belgium Brussels Winter Wonders is one of the biggest events in Belgium. Zheng Huansong/Xinhua via Gettyages Brussels really comes to life at Christmas time thanks to Winter Wonders, which is more akin to a festival than a market. The annual extravaganza, which extends across the Bourse, Place de la Monnaie, Grand Place, Place Sainte Catherine and Marche aux Poissons, is one of Belgium's biggest and most popular events. A light and sound show, ice skating, and fairground rides are among the activities to enjoy, while visitors can also browse through 200 or so chalets serving glühwein, Belgian beers and waffles and stare in wonder at the enormous Christmas tree erected in Grand Place. Is it going ahead this year? Yes. Brussels's Winter Wonders is going ahead with restrictions, including one-way walking systems, while face masks are mandatory. All guests aged 16 or over will have to present a Covid Safe Ticket (CST) to prove they are either fully vaccinated, have recently tested negative or recovered from Covid-19 in the past six months. The market will run from November 26 to January 2, 2022. Related content Christmas vacations: 15 of the best places around the world to go Old Town Square and Wenceslas Square Christmas markets, Prague, Czech Republic Prague has several festive markets, but the main events are those in Old Town Square and Wenceslas Square. Martin Divisek/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock To say Prague goes all out at Christmas is something of an understatement. The Czech Republic capital is the very definition of a winter wonderland during the festive period. While there's no shortage of markets throughout the city, the main ones are found in Old Town Square and Wenceslas Square. Thankfully these spots are only a few minutes' walk apart, so revelers can easily visit both in a day. Old Town Square provides endless entertainment in the form of live shows, dance performances and creative workshops, while Wenceslas Square is great for handmade gifts and locals treats like klobasa (Czech sausage) and mulled wine. Is it going ahead this year? No. The Czech government has imposed a nationwide state of emergency in the country due to a rapid rise in Covid-19 cases, and both markets have been canceled as a result. Fira de Santa Llúcia, Barcelona Dating back to 1786, Fira de Santa Llucia has grown from a one-day event to commemorate the feast day of Santa Llucia, which falls on December 13, to a three-week fair. Held right outside Barcelona Cathedral, the bustling market is separated into four different sections. The first is nativity and figurines, where visitors can pick up nativity scene type decorations and figurines. Greenery and plants is packed with both natural and artificial trees and various types of plants. The crafts section features handmade products and jewelry, while simbombes is designated for musical instruments. There are also many festive activities like storytelling, a Christmas parade, and the caga tio, an enormous pinata-style Christmas log that spills out candy and gifts when beaten with a stick. Is it going ahead this year? Yes. Fira de Santa Llucia will be taking place from November 26 to December 23 this year. I Mercati Natale, Piazza Santa Croce, Florence Piazza Santa Croce provides a stunning setting for the festive market that's brought from Germany to Italy annually. Massimiliano Donati/Awakening/Getty Images There's much to see at this enchanting market, but nothing can top the beautiful backdrop supplied by Santa Croce's Franciscan Basilica. Although this traditional fair is transported from Heidelberg, Germany to Florence every year, it's a very Italian affair in many ways thanks to the scenery and the many Italian treats, such as panforte, for sale. However, there's certainly no shortage of gingerbread, strudel and traditional Heidelberg Lebkuchen cookies. Those who take a walk to the nearby Piazza del Duomo will be treated to a magnificent nativity scene, as well as an impressive Christmas tree that's lit up on December 8 for the Feast of the Immaculate Conception. Is it going ahead this year? Yes. I Mercati Natale began on November 20, 2021 and is set to close on December 19. Advent in Zagreb, Croatia The Croatian capital is buzzing with activity at Christmas, and Advent in Zagreb is undoubtedly its stand-out event. Antonio Bat/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock It's easy to see why Zagreb was voted the \"best Christmas market destination\" in travel portal European Best Destinations' online poll for three consecutive years. The Croatian capital really goes to town during advent. Think live nativity scenes, ice sculpture carvings, outdoor gigs, pop-up bars and a Christmas tram complete with Santa and his elves. Advent in Zagreb also has an area devoted to \"fooling around\" (or \"fuliranje\") where you'll find delighted revelers dancing in the street while eating street food and listening to live entertainment. Is it going ahead this year? Yes. Advent in Zagreb 2021 is currently scheduled to run from November 27 to January 7, 2022. Christmas in Tivoli, Copenhagen, Denmark This Danish amusement park and pleasure garden is even more alluring at Christmas time. Lindblom Stefan/Stella Pictures/Reuters Rumored to be the inspiration behind Disneyland, this Danish amusement park and pleasure garden is a dazzling place to visit any time of year. But you'll struggle to find anywhere as enchanting as Tivoli Gardens during the festive period. With over 500,000 fairy lights adorning the beautiful grounds, and everything from fairground rides to a traditional Pixie Band for entertainment, it's a winter experience like no other. The annual Lucia procession on December 13, where more than 100 girls process through the gardens carrying candles and singing to mark St. Lucia's Day, is a particular highlight, along with the firework displays that take place between December 25 and 26, as well as New Year's Eve. Is it going ahead this year? Yes. Christmas in Tivoli is taking place from November 19 to January 2, 2022. Those aged 15 and older are required to show a valid EU Digital Covid Certificate before entering the amusement park. Tallinn Christmas Market, Estonia Tallinn Christmas Market is the Estonian capital's central winter event. Ints Kalnins/Reuters The Estonian capital's annual affair is one of the more modern European Christmas markets. Set inside Tallinn's Town Hall Square, it's packed full of stalls with traditional Estonian cuisine, artisan bread and handicrafts for sale. On the entertainment front, there's a huge carousel, a winter grotto, an open-air ice rink and a Santa who rolls up on a sleigh complete with reindeers. Visitors are also treated to regular performances by dance troupes and choirs. But as with many such markets, the Christmas tree is the main event. Tallinn's tree has been displayed here since 1441. Is it going ahead this year? Yes. Tallinn Christmas Market 2021 is to take place from November 26 to January 2, 2022. Skansen's Christmas Market, Stockholm Skansen -- a classic annual winter fair in Sweden. Jonathan Nackstrand/AFP/Getty Images Stockholm isn't exactly lacking when it comes to Christmas markets, but none are more traditional than Skansen. Set on the island of Djurgarden in the world's oldest open-air museum, it's a wonderful exhibit of Swedish culture with some added yuletide magic. The historical houses on display in the museum are decked out in colorful decorations for the occasion and all the tables inside are set up for Christmas dinner. Visitors can make their own decorations at Christmas workshops, take part in regular craft demonstrations or join in with the dancing games around the tree at Bollnäs Square, Skansen's main site. Is it going ahead this year? Yes. Skansen's Christmas Market is open on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays from November 26 until December 19. Tuomaan Markkinat, Helsinki This wonderfully Scandinavian Christmas market is held in Helsinki's Senate Square, near the Emperor Alexander II statue. Tuomaan Markkinat's center piece is a vintage carousel, but the nearly 150 vendors selling traditional Christmas delicacies, glogi, Finland's non-alcoholic take on mulled wine, and handicrafts are also a big draw.

      "Pride time National Pride Month began this week, and Democrats in Florida didn’t miss the opportunity to express support for the LGBTQ community. Florida Democratic Party Chair Manny Díaz called Pride Month a time to celebrate diversity and progress. “Fifty-three years after the Stonewall Riots began a new era in the fight for civil rights, the LGBTQI+ community has made great strides to achieve equality and fairness,” Díaz said in a news release. Top Democratic officials also took a moment Wednesday, the start of Pride Month, to criticize Gov. Ron DeSantis and recent policies such as the Parental Rights in Education law, which critics call the “Don’t Say Gay” bill. “Too many face discrimination in the workplace, lack of access to inclusive health care services, and harassment for who they are or for whom they love,” Díaz continued. “Florida needs leaders in the House, Senate, and Governor’s mansion who are committed to protecting LGBTQI+ rights. Instead, Governor DeSantis and conservative lawmakers continue to advance efforts to discriminate against and stigmatize these communities, including the appalling ‘Don’t Say Gay’ legislation.” Agriculture Commissioner Nikki Fried, a Democratic gubernatorial candidate who hopes to face off against DeSantis in November, in her own news release said the Republican-led Legislature spent the 2022 Session attacking progress. “This Legislative Session, we saw an unrelenting attack on the rights and dignity of queer Floridians,” Fried said. “From passing the hateful, discriminatory, and unconstitutional ‘Don’t Say Gay’ and ‘Stop WOKE’ bills to the Governor’s taxpayer-funded communications office perpetrating homophobic conspiracy theories that gay members of the Legislature are ‘groomers,’ it’s so important that we come together this month to celebrate the LGBTQ+ community and defend their rights. Such hate and discrimination have no place in the Sunshine State, and we will never stop fighting for equality and freedom.” However, Democrats’ attacks weren’t limited to Wednesday. The following day, the DeSantis administration moved to exclude gender affirming health care from Medicaid coverage and doubled down on its opposition to providing gender affirming care to children. Then when it came to the budget, DeSantis vetoed support for housing for LGBTQ youth who are at risk of being homeless. U.S. Rep. Charlie Crist, the leading Democratic gubernatorial candidate, criticized DeSantis for the actions regarding gender affirming care. “Today’s report is yet another painful example of our authoritarian bully governor abusing his power and inserting himself into your doctor’s office if he doesn’t like you, doesn’t agree with you, or doesn’t understand you. Free state, indeed,” Crist said in a news release. In turn, Republican officials resisted displays of LGBTQ support from Democrats and companies. DeSantis press secretary Christina Pushaw tweeted multiple critiques of sports teams, companies and institutions — including the U.S. Marine Corps and NASCAR — that made social media posts recognizing the LGBTQ community. “It’s so weird. I don’t think most gay people demand corporations to put pride flags on everything. What they demanded was to be treated equally under the law, which is completely justified. But now that’s the case, this pandering is extremely cringe,” Pushaw tweeted. ___ Coming up, the usual assortment of news, intel, and observations from the week that was in Florida’s capital city by Peter Schorsch, Drew Wilson, Renzo Downey, Christine Jordan Sexton and the staff of Florida Politics. But first … Take 5 The “Takeaway 5” — the Top 5 stories from the week that was: Gov. DeSantis signs budget, vetoes $3.1B — DeSantis vetoed $3.1 billion in spending Thursday as he signed the 2023 fiscal year budget, which still leaves $109.9 billion in place, with increases in nearly every facet of the budget. Federal COVID-19 recovery funds, a swiftly rebounding economy and inflation that has boosted the cost of goods — and therefore sales taxes — helped swell the state’s coffers. That led lawmakers, prodded by DeSantis, to give raises to teachers, prison guards and law enforcement officers. The whopping $3.1 billion veto list includes the $1 billion fund the Legislature set up to pay for additional costs state agencies incur next year due to inflation. SCOFLA won’t touch congressional map before Midterms — The court announced on Thursday it has denied a request for a new hearing on redistricting. That means the final voice on the matter before the 2022 elections will be Florida’s 1st District Court of Appeal, which last month stayed a circuit court decision to replace the map. That means the map designed and signed by DeSantis will govern the 2022 elections. A lawsuit alleging the map violates the Fair Districts amendment to Florida’s Constitution by diminishing the ability of Black constituents to elect a Representative of their choice remains ongoing, but any impact will likely have to wait for a full trial to unfold, something that could take years. DeSantis administration targets LGBTQ issues — Thursday also marked a major day for the DeSantis administration regarding LGBTQ issues. The administration announced it would push a new policy to specifically exclude gender affirming health care from Medicaid coverage. Medicaid Director Tom Wallace issued a report concluding that the gender affirming health care was experimental, a label that precludes it from being a Medicaid covered service. If successful, Florida will join eight other states that have banned Medicaid coverage of gender affirming health care. Moreover, Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo sent a letter to members of the Florida Board of Medicine reiterating his recommendations against providing gender affirming care for children. DeSantis also vetoed $500,000 for the Zebra Coalition, which provides housing to LGBTQ youth who are at risk of being homeless. Abortion rights groups challenge new ban — Abortion rights groups on Wednesday filed a suit to halt Florida’s ban on abortions after 15 weeks of gestation, which is set to take effect in a month. The American Civil Liberties Union of Florida filed the lawsuit in Florida’s 2nd Judicial Circuit on behalf of Planned Parenthood affiliates, other women’s health centers and other abortion rights advocates. The law contains no exceptions for rape or incest, but does provide an exception if it is necessary to save a pregnant person’s life. “This law blatantly rejects Floridians’ need for essential abortion care and their strong support for the right to get an abortion,” ACLU of Florida Legal Director Daniel Tilley said in a news release. Special Olympics International vaccine mandate lifted after DeSantis push — Special Olympics International will no longer require participants in the USA Games to be vaccinated against COVID-19, DeSantis announced Friday. The news comes two days before the scheduled beginning of the eight-day event in Orlando. DeSantis said his administration has been fighting Special Olympics International for six months. The state threatened the organization with a $27.5 million fine if it imposed the requirement, which DeSantis said violated a ban on vaccine passports signed last year. “We’ve never seen something wielded like this vaccine to try to marginalize disfavored people to try to deny people full freedom and full rights,” he said. “We don’t want to fight. We want to play,” Special Olympics International wrote in a release. Part of history Who’s ready to be a part of history? DeSantis is taking names of people who want to lead the rebirth of the Florida State Guard. On the eve of hurricane season, DeSantis’ office raised the storm signal flag, calling for applicants for Director of the State Guard. The State Guard was founded as a World War II-era volunteer force but has been defunct since the 1940s. After DeSantis announced in December that he wanted a dedicated emergency force that doesn’t answer to the federal government, the Legislature reauthorized it in the coming fiscal year’s budget at $10 million. “If you love the state of Florida, have a desire to help your community, and have skills beneficial to protect the state from a disaster, we encourage you to apply to join the FLSG,” according to a news release. Based in St. Augustine, the position will be part-time and pay a $400 to $500 stipend per day. In addition to working as a team and meeting physical, tactical and scheduling requirements, the Governor’s Office asks that applicants be “ready to be a part of history.” The Governor’s Office says the ideal candidate has experience in military-style operations, emergency management, leadership and problem-solving. Unlike the Florida National Guard, the State Guard would answer solely to the Governor without federal deployments, federal missions or federal funding. That means the State Guard won’t be subject to the National Guard’s vaccination requirement. “If we had our own state guard that didn’t report to the Feds and was not obligated to follow those mandates in the first place, then these people wouldn’t even have to worry about getting kicked out,” DeSantis said Thursday. Far out art A pair of Broward County young artists will have their art flown into space on an upcoming SpaceX mission after being named the Grand Prize Winners of the Spring 2022 Florida Space Art Contest. Gator Run Elementary School first grader Jiacheng Yu and Maplewood Elementary School fifth grader Kylie Lopez edged out about 2,500 other artists who participated in the art competition for elementary school students. The budding artists were asked to draw from the theme “Florida is the Place for Space: Celebrating Florida’s Contributions to Space Travel and Exploration.” Art entries were submitted to the Department of State. Staff in the Division of Arts and Culture whittled down from 2,500 to 60 the number of entries for the Lieutenant Governor to review. “I applaud our two grand prize winners. Their stellar works of art exemplifies why Florida is the place for space,” Lieutenant Governor Jeanette Nuñez said. “We are excited for students to enjoy their prize this summer, and we look forward to honoring all of the winners of the contest at a future event.” In addition to the two grand prize winners, Nuñez announced two finalists whose artwork also was recognized: Amelie Lopez, a Tuesca kindergarten student at Dolphin Bay Elementary School in Broward County; Heidi Wang, kindergarten student at Joan Walker Elementary School in Seminole County; Katherine Robidoux, second grade student at Westside Elementary School in Brevard County; Gabriele Priestman, second grade student at Hollywood Central Elementary School in Broward County; Ava Potvin, third grade student at A.D. Henderson University School in Palm Beach County; Paul Ladas, fourth grade student at Palmer Catholic Academy in St. Johns County; Ronak Arya, fourth grade student at Somerset Academy South Campus in Broward County; and Moana Jean, fifth grade student at Odyssey Preparatory Academy in Brevard County. Preaching prep On the first day of hurricane season, Fried issued a list of tips to help consumers prepare for storms and avoid the scams that come after them. “For Floridians, the threat of storms is nothing new. While we always hope for the best, we must all prepare for the worst and not become complacent as we enter the 2022 storm season,” Fried said in a news release. “With the potential of an above-average hurricane season, please take the time to make a plan for yourself and your family before potential threats arise and protect against potential natural disaster-related scams after any storms.” The Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, which Fried oversees, recommends consumers keep all of their vehicles filled with at least a half tank of gas throughout hurricane season and that they keep one car full once the earliest predictions indicate a storm may threaten the state. Pre-purchased fuel can last about six months and can be kept fresh with a fuel stabilizer. It should only be stored in containers meant to hold fuel — not milk jugs or open-top containers. Fried and FDACS also warned consumers to be wary of any contractors who promise quick repairs or cleanup work in the immediate aftermath of a storm. Consumers should do their due diligence by asking for IDs, licenses, proof of insurance, and references. The department urges Floridians not to pay for any repairs or cleanup work in cash. Imposter scams are also common after natural disasters. Though there are several varieties, they often work in the same way — a scammer pretends to be someone trustworthy and tries to convince their mark to send them money or personal information. This may include posing as a government official, inspector, or utility worker and attempting to convince consumers that immediate work is required. Immigration standoff Attorney General Ashley Moody is flagging for U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland what she calls false statements from officials from President Joe Biden’s administration to the U.S. Supreme Court. In a letter sent last week, Moody said Garland’s Department of Justice claimed in its Biden v. Texas arguments that it is longstanding federal policy to use detention capacity as a basis to release detained immigrants who are in the country illegally. However, Moody cited Department of Homeland Security memos from 2014 and 2015 that said the opposite. “It seems there is no limit to what Biden officials will say or do in the furtherance of unlawful policies designed to destroy our southern border and weaken our national security,” Moody wrote. This marks the second time Moody has flagged Biden administration official claims this year. Following the congressional testimony of DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas claiming the Biden administration’s border policies aren’t contributing to the influx of migrants, Moody highlighted an internal document contrary to the claim. “If the Biden administration is willing to mislead co-equal branches of our U.S. government, what aren’t they willing to say to the American public?” Moody continued. Moody’s push also comes as DeSantis looks to revamp his attack on Biden immigration policies. The Governor approved $12 million in the budget to send immigrants who are in the country illegally to other states. Plus, DeSantis expects to sign a bill in the next couple weeks that will cut ties with businesses who help the federal government bring those immigrants to Florida in the first place. The money man More than $36 million in unclaimed property was returned to Florida residents last month, Chief Financial Officer Jimmy Patronis announced this week. Patronis’ office returned $10.7 million in unclaimed property to Miami residents, $7.3 million to West Palm Beach residents and $6 million to Tampa Bay-area residents. As of May, the Division of Unclaimed Property has returned more than $368 million to Florida residents this fiscal year, which Patronis’ office says is a record breaking amount. Since Patronis took office in 2017, more than $1.6 billion in unclaimed property has been returned to Florida citizens. “I have made it my mission as Florida’s CFO to return every last cent back to Floridians and my Unclaimed Property team works hard every day to ensure that happens,” Patronis said in a news release. “There is still more than $2 billion just waiting to be claimed and it only takes a few minutes to search with absolutely no cost to you. Now is the perfect time to search our website and discover if there are any unclaimed treasures in your name.” Residents in other cities also received property returns in May. Orlando residents received $5.4 million, people living in the Fort Myers-Naples area received $3.4 million and Jacksonville residents received $1.4 million. Tallahassee, Pensacola, Panama City and Gainesville residents also received $840,600, $470,300, $382,700 and $374,900, respectively.

Byrd: No worries here Secretary of State Cord Byrd and the state’s election supervisors insist that the state’s voters do not have to worry about potential cybersecurity threats, an ever-present danger ever since Russians were able to successfully hack into the voter registration systems of at least two Florida counties during the 2016 election. A federal agency that deals with cybersecurity threats on Friday issued an advisory on a type of voting system manufactured by Dominion. In a joint statement, Byrd and supervisors pointed out that the report referenced a type of voting system which was not used in Florida in 2020 or during any prior election cycle. “Florida’s voters can be confident in the integrity of Florida’s elections system,” Byrd said. “Florida law is very clear, the paper ballot is the best evidence of a voter’s intent. We recognize that Florida’s robust election laws and procedures are the cornerstone to ensuring efficient, accurate elections and boosting voter confidence about elections administration in our state.” The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency said it had discovered “vulnerabilities” in versions of Dominion Voting Systems Democracy Suite ImageCastX. Eighteen counties in the state use voting systems that are manufactured by Dominion. Leon County Supervisor of Elections Mark Earley, who is also president of the statewide association that represents supervisors, said safeguards in place in the state “protect the voice of our voters.” He added that “the vulnerabilities detailed in the report are analogous to leaving your car unlocked with the keys on the front seat and then being surprised that someone might be able to steal it.” Housing RAP The Office of Insurance Regulation recently announced rules following the property insurance Special Insurance, including rules related to the new Reinsurance Assistance to Policyholders (RAP) Program. The Legislature’s main property insurance measure (SB 2D), which DeSantis signed into law last month, made many changes in an attempt to stabilize Florida’s property insurance market. Among them, it established the RAP Program, which will provide a $2 billion reimbursement layer of reinsurance for hurricane losses directly below the mandatory layer of the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund. OIR also issued a notice regarding rate filing for the RAP Program. “SB 2D requires an insurer that participates in the RAP program for the 2022-2023 contract year to reduce its rates by making a rate filing or amending a pending rate filing with the OIR no later than June 30, 2022, to reflect the cost savings realized by participating in the RAP program,” according to OIR. “An insurer that defers using the RAP program until the 2023 contract year must reduce rates to reflect the cost savings realized by participating in the program in a rate filing submitted to the OIR no later than May 1, 2023. The insurer shall make no other changes to its rates in the filing.” Book’s budget wins Some Democratic lawmakers had little positive to say after DeSantis signed the 2022-23 state budget, but Senate Democratic Leader Lauren Book was able to secure millions for her South Florida district and get it past the Governor’s veto pen. “I was proud to fight to bring home more than $20 million in funding for Broward County,” said Book, whose district will receive funding for water quality projects, health care initiatives and others. Book also touted $23 million in funding for the Nurse-Family Partnership project, and a new program to guide women with cancer diagnoses through treatment and/or survivorship. However, her top accomplishment was in the tax cut bill. “I was proud to pass one of my longstanding priorities in the 2022 tax package: the removal of the sales tax on diapers even if only for a year, we believe this paves the way to a permanent exemption and we will go back to pursue the exemption on adult incontinence products as well,” she said. “While this will truly help families across the state, the agreement only includes infant diapers for one year and I will continue to advocate for a permanent exemption on all diapers, including adult incontinence products, next Session.” The peanut gallery Other Democrats had a harder time finding a silver lining, and several of them issued statements blasting DeSantis for his liberal use of the veto pen. Sen. Shevrin Jones said the $3.1 billion that DeSantis excised from the budget shows “the Governor is more focused on scoring political points in an election year than actually improving people’s lives. “From traffic to workforce development to public safety, Gov. DeSantis vetoed critical needs in our communities that will result in less safe and less economically secure families across the state.” While Gainesville Democratic Rep. Yvonne Hinson said she was pleased that appropriations for the Meridian Behavioral Healthcare Facility and Willie Mae Stokes Community Center were preserved, but that she was “deeply disappointed” that other local requests she worked on were vetoed. The nixed requests included restoration projects for McIntosh Hall and the Gainesville Woman’s Club Restoration as well as funding for the City of Gainesville Paramedic Program. “While he is happy to take resources from the federal government and the American Rescue Plan, he continues to use the funds for unintended purposes all while attacking President Joe Biden,” she said of DeSantis. “Partisan politics should not supersede the responsibility of our state government to ensure the safety and well-being of Floridians.” Wear Orange Tampa Democratic Sen. Janet Cruz is requesting a Special Session on gun violence. In a letter to Byrd, Cruz requested lawmakers hold a third Special Session this year, this time to address the recent rash of gun violence across the nation. “It is imperative that we take common sense steps to address this epidemic of gun violence that has led to atrocities in places like Parkland, FL, Buffalo, NY, and most recently in Uvalde, TX,” Cruz wrote. “We should address these issues with legislation regulating high capacity rifle magazines, mandating universal background checks, and expanding red flag laws. Without concrete action, we will see continued violence, which will be devastating consequences for the people we serve in Tallahassee.” This weekend, advocates against gun violence are asking people to wear orange to honor victims, survivors and their loved ones. Fried is lighting the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services’ Mayo Building orange between Friday and Sunday in their honor. “Today, as we remember all those we have lost, we need more than words. We demand action from our legislators on the federal, state, and local levels to take meaningful action to address this plague in our country, creating a future where everyone can thrive without fear of gun violence,” Fried said. Advocates also reacted to a recent raffle at James Madison Preparatory High School in Madison, which included handguns and semi-automatic rifles. “The ‘2022 Outdoor May Madness’ fundraiser at the James Madison Preparatory High School was aptly named, as it was indeed ‘madness,’” Prevent Gun Violence Florida Board President Patti Brigham said in a statement. “The fact that a high school would hawk firearms, with one of the rafflers claiming, ‘Every country boy needs (a revolver) under the front seat of his truck … I hope that’s legal,’ was not only irresponsible, but reckless.” 2nd Harvest famine Included within DeSantis’ veto list was $1 million for Second Harvest of the Big Bend to expand its outreach. The food bank serves 11 counties in North Florida. But Sen. Loranne Ausley and Rep. Allison Tant dreamed bigger and sponsored a project to expand their coverage. The plan would have helped distribute an additional 1.2 million meals and develop a six-acre educational and agricultural center. Last year, ahead of the current fiscal year, DeSantis OK’d $300,000 for the program. “I was disappointed to see the ($1 million) in funds for America’s Second Harvest of the Big Bend on the Governor’s veto list,” Tant, a Tallahassee Democrat, said in a statement. “At a time when Floridians are experiencing tough times and are facing an affordability crisis, vetoing funds to support food insecurity is wrong and goes against what Floridians need. During the height of the pandemic, the only meals many individuals in Leon and surrounding counties received were from Second Harvest.” “The state’s poorest and most food insecure zip code is Leon’s 32304,” Tant continued. “Second Harvest has worked to expand their footprint and the number of individuals they need to serve has only grown. These funds would have been used to expand their reach into even more counties and would have created new partnerships with community organizations in rural counties.” Everglades green The Everglades Foundation is praising DeSantis for exceeding his four-year commitment to spend more than $2.5 billion on the Everglades and the environment. This year, DeSantis approved $500 million for the Everglades, including $352.6 million for the state-federal Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan that includes the Everglades Agricultural Area Reservoir Project. The funds helped push the state beyond his goal with his fourth budget signed as Governor. In a news release, Everglades Foundation CEO Eric Eikenberg said Florida’s environment is intrinsically linked to its economy. “It’s clear that our state and its leaders understand the link between Florida’s economy and the environment, and this budget signed by the Governor continues to preserve and protect our Everglades, a central part of our state’s water-based and tourism economy,” Eikenberg said. The project, administered by the South Florida Water Management District, includes a treatment wetland that will clean water and a reservoir that will store excess water from Lake Okeechobee. “This Legislative Session was an opportunity to continue our momentum on the EAA Reservoir — a fundamental component of restoring the natural flow of water from Lake Okeechobee through the Everglades to the Florida Keys — and resulted in the funding needed to continue to drive this project forward.” Double time TEMPO It’s not just officials at the state level who are celebrating their victories in the budget. Tallahassee Mayor John Dailey highlighted the capital city’s expected receipt of $500,000 in Department of Juvenile Justice funding to support its youth program, Tallahassee Engaged in Meaningful Productivity for Opportunity (TEMPO). That’s twice what the state offered Tallahassee for the program last year. TEMPO provides a path for disconnected youth to connect with essential services that enable educational opportunities, workforce training and job placement. It targets youth aged 16-24 who are out of school and out of work. Additionally, TEMPO launched a generational poverty stop-gap initiative in 2020 that allows family members of participants to attain their GED diploma, regardless of age. “Since we launched the TEMPO program in 2017, the City has engaged more than 1,900 local youths,” Dailey said in a news release. “Through their continuing success, TEMPO alumni are showcasing the positive trajectory the program provides with a zero percent recidivism rate, more than 400 now employed and 297 enrolled in higher education.” In June 2021, TEMPO graduated its largest GED cohort of 70 students, and this month, more than 80 will graduate from the program with their GED diploma or workforce credential attainment licenses or certificates. “TEMPO has been described as ‘a lifeline’ by many of the participants,” said Kimball Thomas, Tallahassee’s director of Housing and Community Resilience. “Each day through this program, we are reaching a target demographic that represents, according to data, Tallahassee’s largest potential gun violence victims and offender pools.” Capitol Directions Ron DeSantis — Up arrow — DeSantis’ court locked in DeSantis’ map.

Article content 3 p.m. Drugmakers, scientists begin the hunt for long COVID treatments From the Reuters news agency: After producing vaccines and treatments for acute COVID-19 in record time, researchers and drugmakers are turning to finding a cure for long COVID, a more elusive target marked by hundreds of different symptoms afflicting millions of people. Leading drugmakers, including those who have launched antiviral pills and monoclonal antibodies for COVID-19, are having early discussions with researchers about how to target the disease, five scientists in the United States and UK told Reuters. Companies including GlaxoSmithKline, Vir Biotechnology and Humanigen confirmed they had spoken to researchers on trials using their current treatments against long COVID. Others including Pfizer and Roche said they are interested but would not elaborate on plans.

Article content Researchers, biotech companies and public health experts say major pharmaceutical companies are integral to getting a proven treatment for the disease, which currently afflicts more than 100 million people, according to the World Health Organization. “When you look at the numbers for heart failure, for diabetes, etc, that is the ballpark we are talking about,” said Amitava Banerjee, a leading researcher on a long COVID trial. Long COVID, with some 200 reported afflictions that include fatigue, chest pain and brain fog, is defined by symptoms that last longer than 3 months. It sidelines people who have had both mild and severe COVID-19, including children. In the United States, it is estimated to have affected 1-in-7 working-age adults.

Article content Sandi Zack, 53, a former elementary school teacher from the Atlanta area who can no longer work, described symptoms including extreme fatigue, dizziness, pain and heart palpitations since contracting COVID in December 2020. She has sought help from a range of specialists and tried a variety of drugs to ease her symptoms including steroids and the antidepressant fluvoxamine. “We’re all still out here,” she said. “Hoping, and waiting.” There are fewer than 20 clinical trials underway testing drugs, a handful of which have moved beyond early stages, according to interviews with more than a dozen independent and government-backed scientists and a Reuters review of a global clinical trials database. Scientists hope their research will uncover the causes of long COVID, a major hurdle in finding targets for new drugs or identifying existing medicines that may work as treatments.

She said she has held confidential meetings with two venture capital groups and one major pharmaceutical company.

Article content Possible underlying causes researchers are studying include damage from the original infection, lingering reservoirs of virus in the body, an autoimmune response, in which the immune system attacks its own cells, and a dysregulated immune response causing excess inflammation that damages small blood vessels or nerves. It could be a combination of those or other factors, they say. 2:40 p.m. Some immune system memory persists year after COVID infection A year after infection with the coronavirus, when antibodies in the blood are barely detectable, the immune system continues to “remember” the virus and should respond to some extent upon re-encountering it, a study from China suggests.

About 4.25 million people currently have the disease, almost a million more than last week, according to an estimate by the Office for National Statistics. Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced the end of virtually all pandemic-related restrictions in January, betting that the roll-out of the country’s vaccination program and the emergence of the less severe omicron variant would limit deaths and boost economic activity. Next month, most people wanting to take a lateral flow test will have to pay for them. Advertisement 10 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.

After dropping for weeks, the number of elementary and high school students absent because of COVID-19 went up this week. A total of 14,015 were not in school on Tuesday. That’s 40 per cent more than were not in school a week earlier. The figures — from an Education Department update published yesterday — include children who tested positive as well as those who were self-isolating without a positive test. Advertisement 11 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content Of the 14,015 absent on Tuesday, 7,882 were elementary school students, with 5,716 from high schools and 417 in adult education. The number of classes being taught remotely also increased — to 24, from 21. Two schools were closed due to COVID on Tuesday. A week ago, no schools were closed. The number of teachers absent because of COVID is also increasing. On Tuesday, 936 were absent. That compares with 682 last week. The change represents a 37-per-cent increase. The figures indicate 0.69 per cent of all teachers in the province are absent because of COVID, up from 0.5 per cent a week earlier.

The funding, contained in the newly tabled Bill C-17, follows a $4-billion top-up to the federal health transfer last summer and is expected to be a one-time payment. Throughout the pandemic hospitals across the country had to delay non-emergency procedures to make way for urgent COVID-19 cases. That’s led to delayed care for millions of Canadians, on top of already lengthy wait lists for many procedures and diagnostic tests.

Article content 1:30 p.m. Ford says Ontario prepared to handle an increase in cases, hospitalizations From The Canadian Press: Ontario is prepared for an increase in COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations, Premier Doug Ford said Friday, but he wouldn’t say yet if he will reintroduce any public health measures to respond to it. The province reported 667 people in hospital with COVID-19 on Friday, the second day in a row that number has increased. Ontario also reported 2,761 new cases of COVID-19, but the province’s top doctor has said the actual number is likely 10 times higher than the daily log since access to PCR testing is restricted. Another indicator public health experts are using to track COVID-19 activity is wastewater data, and that suggests cases have been on the rise since early-to-mid-March.

Article content Ford said Ontario has taken a very cautious approach to reopen, as one of the last jurisdictions in North America to lift mask mandates — a move that took effect Monday. But when asked at a news conference Friday if he would reintroduce restrictions to respond to a surge, he wouldn’t say. “Let’s continue making sure that we move forward in a cautious way,” he said. “Let’s talk about that – if God forbid that ever happens – at the time.” Health Minister Christine Elliott said the chief medical officer of health predicted that COVID-19 activity would increase as restrictions were loosened. “We are confident that we have the capabilities in our hospitals to be able to take care of anyone who needs a hospital bed or needs to be in intensive care,” she said. Advertisement 16 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content “But this (increase) is something that was suggested we would see in any event, so it’s not surprising to us at all.” Ford and Elliott said Ontario is well-positioned to deal with increasing cases because of a robust hospital capacity, the availability of antiviral treatments, and the province’s high vaccination rate. Ontario can “ramp up” to 3,000 ICU beds, Ford said. But front-line physician Dr. Michael Warner said that’s not so simple. “Those of us who actually work in ICUs know that ramping up to 3000 beds is not only impossible, but a dangerous thing to say,” tweeted Warner, a critical care doctor at Toronto’s Michael Garron Hospital. “It provides false reassurance that we have the person power to manage a surge of that size. Also keep in mind that (about) 30% of COVID ICU patients die.” Advertisement 17 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.

The federal government signed an agreement with Medicago in 2020 to buy 20 million doses once the vaccine was approved by Health Canada, with the option to purchase 56 million more. Health Canada authorized Medicago’s two-dose Covifenz vaccine in February for adults 18 to 64. In clinical trials it was more than 70 per cent effective at preventing COVID-19 infections and 100 per cent effective against severe illness, before the Omicron wave. Advertisement 18 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content Medicago president Takashi Nagao says the WHO has not yet given the company its rationale, but he believes it is because tobacco company Philip Morris owns about one-fifth of Medicago.

In a few weeks, the graduate of Wilfrid Laurier University will finally get a chance to walk across the stage at a convocation ceremony to mark the completion of the bachelor’s program she finished two years ago. It’s something she’s been eager to do ever since what she called an anticlimactic graduation in 2020, when she received her degree in the mail as the pandemic cancelled large in-person public events. “It’s like a burden or something has lifted off my chest, like I can finally commemorate all the work that I put in,” Okezie says in a phone interview. “It might not be a big deal to a lot of people, but it just feels like that was stolen from us.” Advertisement 22 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content Several universities across Canada are planning in-person convocation ceremonies this year after a lengthy hiatus due to COVID-19. Some are also inviting graduates from 2020 and 2021, who missed out on in-person celebrations, to return for the experience. For Okezie, who immigrated to Canada from Nigeria 10 years ago, the opportunity to pick up her diploma in person makes her feel all her hard work is paying off. The effort she’s putting into her walk is one way she’s preparing for the big day. “I’m not gonna fall, I refuse to,” the 24-year-old said with a chuckle. “You only get it once.” Universities say they recognize how important a graduation day can be for students. “Convocation is a major milestone in our students’ lives, it’s a very special day not only for them but for their family and loved ones as well,” Ryerson University president and vice-chancellor Mohamed Lachemi said in a written statement.

The risk of infection is greater than ever, with some 300,000 new cases being reported in Germany in each of the last few days — a figure that probably captures less than half of the true infection level, Lauterbach said. The country has recently reported about 300 daily deaths, a burden that could rise in coming weeks, he warned.

We have be active again.” Most federally-set restrictions in Germany expired last week, with masks only compulsory on public transport and in hospitals and care homes. But states are using a grace period offered by the federal government to keep many measures in place through early April. That contrasts with England and France, where curbs have been dropped and case levels are less elevated. With hospitals struggling in parts of Germany because of high patient loads and many doctors and nurses out sick or in quarantine, Lauterbach has applauded states for maintaining restrictions. He also renewed calls for vaccine mandates, saying that even one dose can reduce the risk of death or severe illness within a week for a previously unvaccinated person.

This is unlike Quebec, that is now offering a fourth dose to all adults. So far in B.C., just over 78,000 people have received a fourth dose of COVID-19 vaccine, primarily in long-term care facilities. Over the next week 75,000 people aged 70 and over will be eligible for their fourth dose. The gap is between third and fourth doses is 182 days. More than a million people eligible for a third dose have not signed up. “What we’re seeing from other countries is that that fourth dose, that second booster, does give a boost in protection against infection and also stimulates a stronger protection from more severe illness and death, but it also wanes again over time,” provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry said on Tuesday.

Try refreshing your browser, or Scientists question the point of swabs up everyone’s nose: ‘We might have overdone it’ For many people worldwide, having cotton swabs thrust up their nose or down their throat to test for COVID-19 has become a routine and familiar annoyance. But two years into the pandemic, health officials in some countries are questioning the merits of repeated, mass testing when it comes to containing infections, particularly considering the billions it costs. Chief among them is Denmark, which championed one of the world’s most prolific COVID testing regimes early on. Lawmakers are now demanding a close study of whether that policy was effective. “We’ve tested so much more than other countries that we might have overdone it,” said Jens Lundgren, professor of infectious diseases at Rigshospitalet, University of Copenhagen, and a member of the government’s COVID advisory group.

Two passengers taking a 10-hour flight from Dubai to Australia in July 2020 infected 15 other people, despite masking requirements for travellers, functioning air purifiers, and use of masks, eye goggles, gloves and protective gowns by the flight crew, according to a report in the Journal of Travel Medicine.

Article content Being seated within two rows of a primary case increased the risk of infection more than seven-fold, and spending more than an hour in the arrival airport increased it nearly five-fold, the study found. Seven of those who caught the virus were seated within 2 rows of the “index cases” in the economy section, but the others were seated far away, including some who were seated in business class. At the time, all passengers entering Australia were required to submit to hotel quarantine and to provide blood samples for COVID-19 tests. Virus particles from the two originally infected travellers and the 15 newly infected passengers had indistinguishable genomic sequences, according to the report. “Conscientious mask wearing during travel reduced the risk of acquiring infection,” particularly for passengers seated nearby, the researchers said. “With the emergence of more transmissible SARS-CoV-2 variants … it is crucial to understand and mitigate potential risk exposures associated with all stages of air travel.” Advertisement 12 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.

He was fighting two wars, he said: one against COVID and one against stupidity. As the United States nears the grim milestone of one million coronavirus-linked deaths, Varon, chief of critical care and COVID-19 at United Memorial Medical Center in Houston, Texas, said only one of those battles has been won. “I think that I have won the fight against the coronavirus. I think I’ve lost the fight against human stupidity,” Varon told Reuters. “The reason why we have lost a million people in this country is because of that fight against human stupidity. I can tell you that the number of deaths that we will have would have been much more smaller if people just listen and do the right thing, if they have a little bit of common sense,” he said.

The more the virus spreads the more chances it has to mutate, leading to variants like Omicron that are partially escaping vaccine protection. He predicts that when Omicron-specific vaccines are finally available the cycle will repeat itself, with rich countries snapping up all the initial supplies while citizens of lower-income countries once again will have to wait.

As reported in PLOS One, recent cancer diagnoses were associated with higher risks for worse COVID-19 outcomes particularly among people with metastatic disease or cancers of the blood, liver or lungs. Higher risk for death was also linked to chemotherapy or radiation treatments within three months before SARS-CoV-2 infection. The study found other disparities among recently-diagnosed cancer patients. In particular, those who were older, Black, received Medicare, and/or lived in the Southern United States were significantly more likely to die after SARS-CoV-2 infection.

      "Some countries managed to suppressed COVID for years, but are now facing huge outbreaks in the face of vaccine complacency Noah Baker and Nicky Phillips ask why vaccine complacency and zero COVID Your browser does not support the audio element. Download MP3 A handful of states around the world have pursued 'COVID zero' strategies. Through a combination of intensive lockdowns, travel restrictions and comprehensive test and trace systems, regions like Tonga, New Zealand, Taiwan, mainland China and Western Australia managed to keep the virus at bay. But now many of these countries are facing new outbreaks on a scale they have not yet seen, and it is being driven in part by vaccine hesitancy. In this episode of Coronapod we discuss how a successful public health campaign can breed new problems when it comes to public perception of risk, and ask how vaccine complacency might be avoided in the future.

      "Health Service Executive CEO Paul Reid has said \"it's never too late\" to register to receive a Covid-19 vaccine, as he urged those who have not yet received a vaccine to come forward. Speaking at today's HSE briefing, Mr Reid that uptake of vaccines has been extraordinary to date and said that the vaccination programme \"gives us a gateway\" to reopen society. However, the briefing also heard that there may have been incidents where unvaccinated healthcare workers have introduced Covid-19 to nursing homes and other healthcare settings. This afternoon, Mr Reid said the programme continues at pace, with a priority now to vaccinate those in the 12-15 age group. He said that 124,000 people in this age group had signed up so far, with 72,000 having been administered with a first dose. HSE chief Paul Reid urges people who are unvaccinated to come forward, adding 'it's never too late'. Those who are not yet vaccinated are at a significantly higher risk, he says. | Read more: https://t.co/PJ6fbXjbQQ pic.twitter.com/rXkfOpF30z — RTÉ News (@rtenews) August 19, 2021 Earlier, he had said that 6.5 million Covid-19 vaccines have been administered in Ireland so far. In a post on Twitter, he said that 84% of the adult population is now fully vaccinated and over 90% are partially vaccinated. At today's briefing, he said he had a \"clear call\" for those who have not yet come forward for a vaccine. \"We're continuing to see high daily case numbers,\" Mr Reid said. \"It's never too late to register, it's never too late to get vaccinated. \"Today, I would like to make a very specific and clear call to those who have not yet come forward for vaccination. The first message is very clearly, be assured, vaccinations are working. \"The evidence is extremely strong, in terms of reduced illness, reduced hospitalisations coming through, reduced ICU admissions, and indeed, reduced mortality.\" HSE chief Paul Reid says nobody could ever have predicted the level of uptake of vaccines in Ireland. 'But we're really anxious to finish this job off,' he says. | Read more: https://t.co/PJ6fbXjbQQ pic.twitter.com/938XemoQzR — RTÉ News (@rtenews) August 19, 2021 As of today, there were 244 patients with Covid-19 in hospitals, down from 249 on the same period yesterday. Of these, 52 patients are in intensive care units. The Department of Health said 1,818 new cases of Covid-19 were reported in Ireland today. Chief Medical Officer Dr Tony Holohan has said that 43% of patients in ICUs are below the age of 50 and that the incidence of the disease is increasing across all age groups. Mr Reid said that if you are vaccinated, you have significantly higher levels of protection from being hospitalised or entering ICU. He said the highest percentage of patients with Covid-19 in ICU are unvaccinated, with 62% of ICU cases in hospitals not vaccinated at all. Covid-19: 62% of ICU cases in hospitals are not vaccinated at all, says Paul Reid. 15% are partially vaccinated. | Read more: https://t.co/PJ6fbXjbQQ pic.twitter.com/YmrctmmKye — RTÉ News (@rtenews) August 19, 2021 \"You are putting yourself at a higher level of risk,\" if you do not get vaccinated, according to the HSE CEO. Mr Reid was asked about concerns raised about the potential declining efficacy of the vaccines over time, and the potential need for booster shots. He said that the evidence the vaccines are working well is the number of hospitalisations now compared to the last surge in January. He said the HSE would await guidance in the area of booster shots and that the National Immunisation Advisory Committee is assessing the evidence. On the topic of schools, Mr Reid said a lot of work is going into ensuring they re-open as planned over the coming weeks and the HSE is \"anxious\" to see that happen. He said: \"What we have seen in previous school terms is really good support from principals, teachers, schools overall around public health measures and well supported by our newest teams on testing and tracing and schools have progressed really well, even during really bad wave last time, and we would expect the same again.\" He said the positivity rate in terms of testing among the 21-30 age group is high at 21%. He said just under half of all cases being reported are among people aged 19-44. The HSE's national lead on testing and tracing Niamh O'Beirne told the briefing today that the testing positivity level for Covid-19 in the community is continuing to rise. She said that it is 14% at the moment in community test centres and is continuing to grow. Test sites in Cavan, Mayo, Galway and Tralee are particularly busy. Over the past week, 13,000 new cases were detected, which is an increase of 16% on the previous week. Ms O'Beirne also said that 47% of close contacts identified are fully vaccinated.

In the week ending 8 August, there were 42 such cases. This is up from 16 the previous week. Professor Cormican described this increase as a concern, and said the HSE is linking in with hospitals to understand what is driving this rise. Separately, he said that there are instances where unvaccinated healthcare workers may have contributed to the introduction of the virus to certain settings. People may have to be redeployed if they are unvaccinated in some cases, he added. Professor Cormican said: \"I want to be guarded in this because I think one of the things you don't want to get into is targeting anybody, but I think what we are seeing from the public health is there are instances, certainly, where we are concerned that unvaccinated healthcare workers may have contributed to the introduction of virus into certain settings. \"I'm sure that wasn't their intention. \"And we have to understand that there is some hesitancy around vaccination and we tried to work with colleagues on that, but there is clearly, we would be a lot more comfortable if all health care workers looking after vulnerable people were fully vaccinated.\" There are instances where unvaccinated healthcare workers may have contributed to the introduction of the virus to certain settings, says Martin Cormican.

In a statement, the Irish Hospital Consultants Association (IHCA) said the number of people waiting for inpatient or day case treatment has grown by more than 31,000 in the past decade - an increase of 69%. It said there has been a 100-fold increase in those waiting on the same list for longer than 12 months since May 2012 (from 199 people to 20,820 in May 2021). The statement said that Covid-19 and the HSE cyber attack \"cannot mask long-standing capacity and consultant deficits in the Irish healthcare system\". IHCA Vice President Professor Rob Landers said: \"Over the last decade, the situation has progressively deteriorated to a point where we are now in an absolute crisis. \"The Government and health service must stop hiding behind the pandemic and cyber attack as the main reasons for our growing waiting lists. \"We need multi-annual budgeting from the Department of Health and to bring together a plan to sort this problem out once and for all.\"\n",

Cases are rising everywhere.” Based on what is happening in some U.S. states and some European countries, Quebec’s daily case count could reach 1,000 or 2,000, he said. After falling below 100 in July, infections have been on the rise in Quebec. The province’s seven-day rolling average is now 365. Quebec has not had more than 1,000 cases since May, and the province has not passed the 2,000-case threshold since January.

He said he hopes the fourth wave is short, “and the best way to make sure it’s short is for everyone to get vaccinated.” We apologize, but this video has failed to load. tap here to see other videos from our team.

Article content 10:15 a.m. The world may never reach herd immunity, experts say From the Bloomberg news agency: As COVID-19 surged last year, governments worldwide touted the hope of “herd immunity,” a promised land where the virus stopped spreading exponentially because enough people were protected against it. That’s now looking like a fantasy. The thinking was that the pandemic would ebb and then mostly fade once a chunk of the population, possibly 60 per cent to 70 per cent, was vaccinated or had resistance through a previous infection. But new variants like Delta, which are more transmissible and have been shown to evade these protections in some cases, are moving the bar for herd immunity near impossibly high levels. Delta is spurring widening outbreaks in countries like the U.S. and U.K. that have already been walloped by the virus, and presumably have some measure of natural immunity in addition to vaccination rates of more than 50 per cent. It’s also hitting nations that have until now managed to keep the virus out almost entirely, like Australia and China. Advertisement 19 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content This month, the Infectious Diseases Society of America estimated that Delta had pushed the threshold for herd immunity to well over 80 per cent and possibly close to 90 per cent. Public health officials like Anthony Fauci have drawn controversy by shifting the goalposts over the past year, increasing the number of people who need protection before hitting herd immunity. Meanwhile, vaccine hesitancy and supply issues mean most countries won’t get close to even the original numbers. “Will we get to herd immunity? No, very unlikely, by definition,” said Greg Poland, director of the Vaccine Research Group at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. Even a vaccination rate of as high as 95 per cent wouldn’t achieve it, he said. “It is a neck and neck race between the development of ever more highly transmissible variants which develop the capacity to evade immunity, and immunization rates.” Advertisement 20 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content Nature isn’t going to solve the problem, either. It’s unclear how long natural immunity gained from surviving COVID-19 will last, and whether it will be effective at fighting off new strains. Future variants, including some that could evade immunity even more efficiently than delta, raise questions about how — and when — this will be over. “If it was as simple as getting the infection once means you are immune for life, that would be great, but I don’t think that’s the case,” said S.V. Mahadevan, director of South Asia Outreach at the Center for Asian Health Research and Education at Stanford University Medical Center. “That’s a troubling problem.” 10:05 a.m. Pandemic updates from around the world From the Bloomberg and Reuters news agencies: Advertisement 21 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content Children hospitalized with COVID-19 in U.S. hits record number The number of children hospitalized with COVID-19 in the United States hit a record high of just over 1,900 on Saturday, as hospitals across the South were stretched to capacity fighting outbreaks caused by the highly transmissible Delta variant. The Delta variant, which is rapidly spreading among mostly the unvaccinated portion of the U.S. population, has caused hospitalizations to spike in recent weeks, driving up the number of pediatric hospitalizations to 1,902 on Saturday, according to data from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. U.K.’s vaccinated offered clothes, vouchers Asda and lastminute.com joined the growing number of companies to offer discounts and incentives to vaccinated customers in the U.K. The corporate push is part of the government’s efforts to get more young people to get vaccinated against COVID-19. Advertisement 22 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content This month, the government extended vaccines to 16- and 17-year-olds for the first time. The government also announced that from Monday, those who are double vaccinated or under the age of 18 will no longer have to self isolate if they come into contact with someone with COVID-19. The need for people to self isolate after a COVID-19 contact has led to shortages of workers in some key industries in recent weeks because of the spread of the delta variant. Vaccine hesitancy reaches Mexico’s youth – along with Delta variant As the Delta variant of the COVID virus sweeps through Mexico’s cities, more adults in their 30s and 40s are ending up in the hospital, with polls showing vaccine hesitancy is rising in younger age groups. At the height of the pandemic in January, 10 per cent of people hospitalized for COVID-19 were aged between 18 and 39, according to the health ministry. Cases have now surged again to near-record levels and that percentage has tripled. Advertisement 23 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.

LILLEY: Del Duca's plan to make COVID shots mandatory for schools may anger parents Photo by FRANK GUNN / THE CANADIAN PRESS FILES Article content Without knowing it, Ontario Liberal leader Steven Del Duca may have just added a shot of excitement into the provincial election.

Try refreshing your browser, or LILLEY: Del Duca's plan to make COVID shots mandatory for schools may anger parents Back to video As Del Duca himself would tell you, he’s not a very exciting man and so far, this election campaign has been anything but exciting. His pledge to add the COVID-19 vaccine to the list of scheduled, what some call mandatory, vaccinations for school children might change that. “If elected, Ontario Liberals will make the COVID-19 vaccine for kids part of the universal roster of vaccines that are required for kids to attend publicly-funded schools,” Del Duca said Saturday. He claimed to be relying on science and medical advice, but each time Dr. Kieran Moore has been asked about this, he’s said there needs to be more study. For a variety of reasons, Moore has said he isn’t ready to add this vaccine to the school list. Del Duca is making a political, not a medical or scientific play here. Advertisement 3 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content Despite vaccinations being open to children aged 5-11 since late last year, uptake hasn’t been that high. Del Duca thinks his policy is the right way to increase vaccinations, but it might just be a way to anger parents who’ve been hesitant about giving a shot to their children they’ve already taken themselves. According to the Public Health Agency of Canada, which tracks vaccine administration across the country, the percentage of adults aged between 18 and 49 who are fully vaccinated in Ontario ranges from 87-89%. Those are the ages of people most likely have children in the school system and the vast majority are vaccinated. Yet for the 5-11 age range, just 55% have one dose and 39% have two compared to 83% in the 12-17 year old age range with two shots.

Yet, I can recall the anxiety that parents of young children have about vaccinations, what to feed their kids, what to give them and what to protect them from. These are very real concerns for parents. It’s not a matter of timing, the vaccine has been available for six months and the interval between doses is supposed to be no more than two months. There have been community clinics, school clinics, appointments available at local pharmacies at all hours but the uptake isn’t there.

Try refreshing your browser, or Not enough for Del Duca who not only blames Doug Ford but also loses the plot by getting highly personal. “I think a lot of parents in this province have seen the current leader of the province effectively wave a white flag of surrender on vaccinations because Doug Ford, from the very beginning, has wanted this to be all over,” Del Duca said. Advertisement 5 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content It’s a nasty tendency of the former Wynne attack dog to ascribe to his opponents the worst motives. To not just say that they’re wrong on policy but to claim Ford has a moral failing in not being able to raise vaccination rates for kids. Across Canada though, just 41% of kids in that age group are fully vaccinated, which means that Ontario isn’t an outlier. Among provinces that have significant populations, Alberta is at the lowest at 32% while Quebec is the highest and they’re only at 48%. Parents across Canada, and across party and political lines, have concerns about giving their youngest kids the COVID-19 vaccine. For Del Duca, the answer appears to be that he should force it or appear to force it on them. Parents aren’t holding their young children back from being vaccinated due to some moral failing of Ford that Del Duca wants to rant about, they’re holding them back because they have concerns. A leader would deal with those concerns. Ford has said he’d consult with Dr. Moore, Del Duca obviously wants to rely on his pollster rather than doctors. blilley@postmedia.com Share this article in your social network Latest National Stories Advertisement 1 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.

She said cases on the island increased for a fifth consecutive week, but the rise has not been steep. “We are at the same level we were at in mid-September during the fourth wave,” Drouin said, adding she expects cases to continue to rise in the coming weeks. Many of the new infections are among children age five to 11, who only recently became eligible for vaccinations, Drouin said. Case counts are also rising in people age 35 to 54, likely because they are in contact with young children, she said.

Drouin said about one-third of Montreal Island children have either gotten the jab or have booked appointments to get it. Vaccinations are beginning in Montreal schools, she added. But Drouin had a message for parents: “If you are able to go to a mass vaccination centre, take an appointment as soon as possible – your child will (gain) immunity (sooner) for the holidays.

The faster Quebec increases its overall vaccination coverage, the easier it will be to control transmission across all age groups, Drouin said. Montreal has one case of the Omicron variant – a fully vaccinated asymptomatic person who is now in isolation and who “has not been in contact with the community,” she said. Drouin said public health is closely monitoring the situation and is preparing to increase the intensity of contact tracing should more Omicron be found. She added: “We are taking a vigilant approach with the variant but we are not at a stage where we have to panic. “In Quebec, we have a high vaccination rate. We haven’t lost good habits for masks in public places, for physical distancing. Advertisement 9 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.

That measure was dropped in mid-November. In response, Drouin said she has not seen an increase in outbreaks in high schools. But she said Montreal public health has recommended that mask mandates be re-introduced in a few high schools due to particular epidemiological situations.

Article content Prime Minister Boris Johnson issued a “call to get jabs in arms” on Wednesday as Britain stepped up its COVID-19 booster program to fend off the Omicron variant after another 10 cases of the new strain were identified. Britain has now recorded 32 cases of the Omicron variant, which appears to be more transmissible, while tests continue to see whether it causes more severe disease or if vaccines are less effective against it. “It is very likely that we will find more cases over the coming days as we are seeing in other countries globally,” said Jenny Harries, chief executive of the UK Health Security Agency. Johnson announced a new target this week to offer all adults a booster vaccine shot by the end of January, which means speeding up the country’s program by an extra million doses a week.

Article content With the emergence of the Omicron variant, people needed to come forward, he said. “This isn’t a call to arms, but a call to get jabs in arms. And quickly,” he said on Twitter. Britain has recorded more than 10.2 million COVID cases and almost 145,000 deaths since the pandemic started. First reported in southern Africa a week ago, Omicron has spread to more than a dozen countries, spooking financial markets. Governments have responded by reintroducing some travel restrictions. Health Secretary Sajid Javid said booster vaccines would help protect against severe disease from Omicron, even if it turns out the shots are not as effective against the variant as against previous strains of the disease. Government data shows 81 per cent of the population aged over 12 have had two doses of vaccine, while 32 per cent have had a booster shot, or third dose.

The federal government is in discussions with the provinces on that issue but is ready to act to implement such a requirement for incoming U.S. air travellers if necessary, he said. “We made a decision right now about testing every traveller coming in from around the world other than the U.S. We are having discussions,” Alghabra said. “We need to be prepared and ready if we need to adjust that decision to include travellers from the U.S. We haven’t made that decision yet.” Advertisement 14 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content Alghabra said a decision would be based on “the epidemiology in the U.S., around the world.” Ottawa announced on Tuesday that all air travellers entering Canada, except for those coming from the U.S., would need to be tested for COVID-19 upon arrival at the airport and isolate until they get their results, even if they are fully vaccinated against the virus. The stricter measures come as public health officials around the world warn of the potentially dangerous new Omicron variant of COVID-19. The federal government has also closed its border to foreign nationals who have recently travelled through 10 African countries, including Nigeria. Canada has now confirmed cases in British Columbia, Ontario, Quebec and Alberta — all involving people who recently returned from Nigeria.

That was faster than the “weeks” the WHO had predicted last week that it would take to assess the data available on the variant after designating it a “variant of concern,” its highest rating. Advertisement 17 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content Whether the variant is more transmissible or evades vaccines are some of the major questions that still need answering. Vaccine developers have said it will take about two weeks to assess whether their shots are effective against it. Van Kerkhove said one possible scenario was that the new variant, which was first reported in southern Africa, may be more transmissible than the dominant Delta variant. She said it was not yet known if Omicron makes people more ill. WHO chief scientist Soumya Swaminathan said the agency believes the existing COVID-19 vaccines will work against the variant. Mike Ryan, WHO’s emergency director, reiterated the agency’s opposition to the blanket bans on flights to and from southern Africa that have been imposed by Britain and other countries, saying it would not prevent the variant’s spread.

That’s the highest one-day case count since April. Note: an earlier blog item said the province was going to post 1,200 new cases today. That’s the number Health Minister Christian Dubé said would be reported. Hospitalizations continue to mount and are now at a level not seen in a month.

Article content 9:50 a.m. Quebec’s daily case count hasn’t been this high since April Quebec’s daily case count continued to climb Wednesday, with the province reporting just under 1,200 new infections, the most since April. Hospitalizations are also climbing and are now at a level not seen in a month. “Twelve hundred cases today, I don’t like that because it’s a major increase,” Health Minister Christian Dubé said, adding that it’s worrying because “we’re not finished with the vaccination of children, we’re not finished with (booster shots) for seniors.” He said Quebec expected cases to climb to the 1,000 to 1,200 range this fall. “So there’s no panic with that, but we want to make sure that we stay there and that’s the reason we ask people to follow the measures.” Advertisement 22 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content Dubé noted about 650,000 Quebecers eligible for vaccines have opted not to get the shot. He urged them to reconsider their decision. “We are at the arrival of a new variant and we’re at the beginning of the winter,” he added. Premier François Legault “has told me to concentrate on vaccinations and to assure ourselves that when Christmas arrives we have the lowest number of cases possible.” He said the current number of COVID-19 hospitalizations is “very manageable.” However, “when I see daily net hospitalizations increases of 10 (on three of the last four days), it means there’s more pressure on the health system.” The minister said he spoke to health officials from across Canada on Tuesday night and he is confident that within two weeks, a lot more will be known about the worrying new Omicron variant, including whether it’s more transmissible than other strains and whether current vaccines are effective against it.

Article content Dubé said he’s happy the federal government quickly introduced new border measures in response to Omicron. Specific restrictions are now in effect for 10 countries. However, airport testing for all air travellers apart from those arriving from the United States is still not in place. “We’re going to be following that very closely in the coming days,” Dubé said. In addition, he said, federal Health Minister Jean-Yves Duclos has told him that if need be Ottawa could move quickly to impose arrival testing on travellers from the U.S. Dubé was asked about the controversy that erupted this week after Legault raised the prospect of allowing up to 25 people to gather for parties in homes during the holidays. At the moment, the maximum is 10. Advertisement 24 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content Critics accused Legault of raising expectations and potentially causing confusion. Dubé was asked if the premier’s comments put pressure on him to relax rules. “No pressure,” he answered. “I have enough pressure from my wife to organize a Christmas party that I don’t need more pressure.” Dubé added: “It’s normal that we have the urge to return to (a normal) Christmas. It’s in that context that (Legault) said it. “On the other hand, what I wanted to remind people this week is that we sometimes forget the current measures. And at the moment private parties, the maximum number is 10 people.’” We apologize, but this video has failed to load. tap here to see other videos from our team.

Article content 8:45 a.m. New federal travel measures that exempt U.S. greeted with relief Travel agent Gena Ray breathed a sigh of relief Tuesday afternoon upon discovering the magnitude of new travel measures announced by Ottawa. “It wasn’t as bad as I feared,” Ray, who works for Direct Travel in Montreal, said by telephone. “They’re taking precautions, on a day-by-day basis, which is the right thing to do. This pandemic is here to stay until it’s globally under control.” As Canada works to stop the spread of the Omicron coronavirus variant, Health Minister Jean-Yves Duclos said the federal government will start requiring people who fly in from all countries except the U.S. to take a COVID-19 test upon arrival — starting immediately. Ottawa is also expanding a ban on travellers from southern Africa to include Egypt, Malawi and Nigeria.

      "A leading Islamic scholar is calling on Muslims to ignore disinformation campaigns aimed at discouraging them from taking the COVID-19 vaccine. Sheikh Muhammad Tahir ul-Qadri says a series of conspiracy theories circulating on social media is leading to vaccine hesitancy in Muslim populations, which goes against the tenets of Islam. \"Saving lives is an act of worship,\" he told Sky News in an exclusive interview. \"At the start of the pandemic, Muslims around the world were among those in the forefront. \"They put their maximum efforts into saving lives, providing people with food and every kind of necessary support. In the same way, they should come forward now.\" Live COVID news from UK and around the world Advertisement Canadian-based Sheikh Tahir seeks to reassure his three million followers on social media, in an effort to counter the spread of fake news about the COVID-19 vaccines. \"Some people are saying that there is alcohol in it, or pork or other things forbidden (in Islam). Some say these vaccines may affect certain parts of the brain. What can I say? These are totally baseless claims.\" \"This is a matter of medicinal development, of life, and it is just the same as when we take paracetamol, antibiotics, or aspirins despite their side effects. \"Believing in the medical process is one of the basic teachings of Islam. Islam and the teachings of the Koran the Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, is focused on reason, intelligence, scientific research, and intellectual development.\" Vaccine hesitancy is increasingly being seen as one of the reasons why groups described as BAME, many of who are Muslim, may not receive the COVID-19 vaccine at the same level as the rest of the population. Dr Winston Morgan, a leading researcher in medical outcomes based on race and ethnicity, says this is yet another way COVID-19 is harming BAME communities. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 2:47 Coronavirus worries for BAME people \"What is described as vaccine hesitancy is more a lack of enthusiasm or faith in the system that has failed certain groups in the past,\" he said. \"If you do not believe from past experiences that medical treatments will work well for people like you and in certain cases could actually harm you, not because of genetics linked to race, but because of structural disadvantages, you are unlikely to be enthusiastic when a new, and what could be described as a controversial, vaccine comes along.\" Dr Morgan cites research which shows that BAME groups generally say they are less likely to take the vaccine. In one study 72% of black people said they are unlikely or very unlikely to be vaccinated. He warns against overstating the case about hesitancy. \"The temptation will be to blame hesitancy rather than the structural problems based on class and race which have always plagued healthcare delivery to BAME communities. \"Based on the government's past records, it is likely they will also fail to meet vaccination targets. Having a ready-made excuse like vaccine hesitancy amongst BAME groups would be a convenient excuse.\" Much was made of the Muslim husband and wife scientists behind the German company BioNTech, which teamed up with Pfizer to produce one of the world's leading COVID-19 vaccines. Doctors Ugur Sahin and Ozlem Tureci are children of Turkish migrants who moved to Germany in the late 1960s. The British Islamic Medical Association (BIMA) has urged Muslims to take the vaccine on the advice of their medical practitioners and following informed consent. \"It is important to make sure they participate in the vaccine campaign. This is a health issue, not a faith issue.\" said Dr Sharif Kaf Al-Ghazal, president of BIMA. Muslims who want to travel to Saudi Arabia for pilgrimage are being advised by the country's Hajj and Umrah Minister Mohammed Benten to take the coronavirus vaccine before traveling. Dr Al-Ghazal agrees this could help convince more Muslims.\n",
